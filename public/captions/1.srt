Stanford University

[BREAK]

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,380
This is BIO 150 isn't it? Okay, I just

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,220
wanted to make sure. [BREAK] Okay, so we start off

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,090
with a scenario. 40 year old guy â€” quiet

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,080
suburban life. Married 15 years, two

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,359
kids, three and a half dogs, everything

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,429
standard, everything's going wonderfully.

[BREAK]

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,149
And one day out of nowhere, he punches

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,940
somebody in the face at work. Totally

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,920
bizarre, out of character. The guy is

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
standing there by the water cooler and

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,540
makes some comment on some baseball team,

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,850
takes exception to it punches him in the

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,360
face.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,379
Utterly strange. [BREAK] Things are quiet. Three

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,960
months later, his wife of 15 years, happy

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,850
marriage, discovers he's having an affair

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,250
with a 16 year old checkout kid down at

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,730
the Safeway. Really weird. [BREAK] Then, three

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,579
months after that, he absconds with all

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,960
the money at work, embezzles it,

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,140
disappears, and is never seen again.

[BREAK]

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,680
Three possibilities. First one, this guy is a

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,130
truly deep creep. Second, he is having the

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,409
most immature midlife crisis you could

27
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,189
ever imagine.

28
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,400
Third possibility, he has a mutation than

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,939
one gene in his head. [BREAK] And what we'll be

30
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,250
seeing is this is exactly the profile

31
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,960
that you get in a certain neurological

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,840
disease where it's one gene that's out

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,020
of whack. First demonstration of that.

[BREAK]

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,689
Okay, just to get a sense of who's here... how

35
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,420
many of you think there is a genetic

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,040
influence on sexual orientation?

[BREAK]

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,380
Okay, how many think it is possible for

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,960
prenatal events to influence your

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,909
political opinions thirty years later?

[BREAK]

40
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,009
Okay, how many think that there is a

41
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,860
valid way of using biology to understand

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,369
who's religious and who isn't? Yeah,

43
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,899
not quite as many hands there.

[BREAK]

44
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,370
Okay, as long as we're in that

45
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,539
terrain, how many people believe in God?

[BREAK]

46
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,020
How many people believe in souls? 

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,350
How many people believe in evil? How many

48
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,720
people believe in free will? That's gonna change.

[BREAK]

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, oh, I might as well ask, is there

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,100
anybody in this room who actually does

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,270
believe in evolution? Just wanted to make

52
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,800
sure, see what we're dealing with here...

[BREAK]

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,260
Okay, how many think that there is a

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,450
genetic influence and that there's a

55
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,030
basic biological difference, a sex

56
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,170
difference, in levels of aggression? How

57
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,300
many think there's biological basis of

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,430
sex differences in intelligence? 

[BREAK]

59
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,210
Okay, who thinks is all explained by nature? Who

60
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,120
thinks it's all explained by nuture?

[BREAK]

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,090
Who think there's a magnificent, fascinating,

62
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,190
nuanced interaction between nature and nurture?

[BREAK]

63
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,570
Yay! Okay, well everybody's gonna get an

64
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,130
A+ then. You already have the course

65
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,750
under control.

[BREAK]

66
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,180
Okay, so we start off trying to find something in common. Look

67
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,160
at these four events here... or not... in

68
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,840
terms of being scraped out there, but

69
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,670
these are four circumstances that have

70
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,760
something surprising in common.

[BREAK]

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,070
Having your period,

72
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,750
having a brain tumor,

72
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,750
eating a lot of junk food,

73
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,610
taking anabolic steroids.

[BREAK]

74
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,380
Those of you were not oriented to it, that's

75
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,240
the ones that build up your muscle, like

76
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,670
testosterone derivatives. [BREAK] Okay, these all

77
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,440
have something in common. [BREAK] Having your

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,960
period, having a brain tumor, eating a lot

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,030
of junk food, and taking a lot of

80
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,240
anabolic steroids. [BREAK] Anybody want to fathom

81
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,980
a guess what's the commonality amongst

82
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,050
the four of them? [BREAK] Yeah? [Audience]: Hormones. [BREAK] Hormones good okay

83
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,300
we're off and running with hormones, good.

84
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,690
Even more specific than that.

85
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,930
Something they all have in common. Come

86
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,459
on, somebody want to guess? I see these

87
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,440
brief movements of hands, there's people

88
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,070
change their mind. [BREAK] Okay, it all has to do

89
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,440
with hormones. "They all have hormones in

90
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,730
common," I say, trying to facilitate

91
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,580
somebody making the next guess. [BREAK] Oh c'mon,

92
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,010
they all have something... okay, we've got

93
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,330
to get out of here at some point. These

94
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,340
all have four things in common. [BREAK] All of

95
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,040
these have been used successfully in

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,950
courts of law to explain the behavior of

97
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,340
a murderer. [BREAK] In the first case...

98
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,440
in the first case, a number of cases,

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,960
where the fact that a woman was having

100
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,850
her period at the time of killing

101
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,970
someone was part of what a jury said led

102
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,620
them to exonerate the person. [BREAK] A

103
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,270
literature showing that a

104
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,070
disproportionate share of female

105
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,380
aggression comes around the time of

106
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,950
menses. [BREAK] Next one. There is an area of the

107
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,230
brain you will know so much about over

108
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,430
the next three months called the

109
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,790
amygdala, that has something to do with

110
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,260
aggression and has something to do with

111
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,230
fear... and you get a brain tumor there, and

112
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,360
in a number of cases, you get someone who

113
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,960
is uncontrollably violent... and this has

114
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,669
also been used successfully in a court

115
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:30,290
of law.

[BREAK]

116
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,090
Junk food. Any of you who are San

117
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,790
Francisco history buffs will know 20

118
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,260
years ago, 30 years ago, at Dan White, a

119
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,970
dissappointed office seeker assassinated

120
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,130
the American Francisco, along with Harvey

121
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,190
Milk. [BREAK] And as part of his remarkably

122
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,470
successful defense for a double murderer

123
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,660
that led to a remarkably short jail

124
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,020
sentence, was the famed Twinkie defense.

[BREAK]

125
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,840
The argument that his addiction to junk

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,450
food caused wild fluctuations in his

127
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,370
blood sugar levels, which caused him to

128
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,419
do that.

[BREAK]

129
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,720
Finally, anabolic steroids. Any number of

130
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,640
cases of people having uncontrolled

131
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,890
violence arguing, because they were

132
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,110
weight lifters, and a wildly abusive

133
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,180
range of taking this stuff, had something

134
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,580
to do with violence. [BREAK] Put all four of

135
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,830
these together and we get the first of

136
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,810
the two points of this entire course...

[BREAK]

137
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,050
Which is... sometimes the stuff that's

138
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,539
going on in your body can dramatically

139
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,260
influence what goes on in your brain.

[BREAK]

140
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,270
Second critical point: tonight when

141
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,560
you've settled back down and you're

142
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,419
ready to go to sleep and you're nice and

143
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,460
relaxed and your hearts beating nice and

144
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,010
slow, think the following thought:

[BREAK]

145
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,020
You know, that heart isn't going to beat

146
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,189
forever.

[BREAK]

147
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,559
Think about... think about your lips

148
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,659
turning blue after the- think about the

149
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,059
blood flow slowing down. Think about your

150
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,429
feet and your toes getting cold and at

151
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:56,580
that point you will probably be

152
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,689
increasing the rate at which that heart

153
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,550
beats and you will have just seen the

154
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,099
second key thing in this course. [BREAK] Which is,

155
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,589
sometimes what's going on in your head

156
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,259
will affect every single outpost in your

157
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,689
body. [BREAK] And what this course is about is

158
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,479
the intertwining, the interconnections,

159
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,419
between your physiology and your

160
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,669
behavior. The underlying emotions,

161
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,949
thoughts, memories all of that, and the

162
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,800
capacity of each to deeply influence the

163
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,339
others under all sorts of circumstances.

[BREAK]

164
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:28,449
Now, what we're going to be doing with

165
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,939
this is trying to understand this under

166
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:32,879
fairly difficult circumstances.

[BREAK]

167
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,649
If everybody here was here because they

168
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,319
really wanted to understand why all the

169
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,209
wildebeest on earth mate in the same

170
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,579
week each year, we'd have a fighting

171
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,739
chance of figuring that one out, but

172
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,719
that's not what we want to understand.

[BREAK]

173
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:48,339
We don't want to understand why birds

174
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,860
migrate and don't get lost. We want

175
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,949
to understand human behavior. [BREAK] Worse than

176
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,929
that, harder than that, human social

177
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:58,479
behavior. [BREAK] And hardest of all in some

178
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,149
cases, some grossly abnormal human

179
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,699
behavior. [BREAK] And if you're going to try to

180
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,039
do that there's a problem, which is,

181
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,129
officially, it's complicated. [BREAK] It is a huge,

182
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,349
messy process trying to make sense of

183
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,459
the biology of human social behavior.

[BREAK]

184
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,409
And just as all sorts of realms when one

185
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,809
deals with messy, complicated problems

186
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,909
that you need to think about in some

187
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:24,759
wildly, interacting way, we all have a

188
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,669
strategy that we come up with. [BREAK] A strategy

189
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,999
to make things easier. [BREAK] Which is that we

190
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,639
think in categories. We think in

191
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,649
categories, we take things that are

192
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,578
continua,

193
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:39,339
and we break them into categories. 

[BREAK]

194
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,698
And we label those categories and we do that in

195
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,410
various settings because it could be

196
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,790
extremely useful.

[BREAK]

197
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,139
For example, somebody give me an estimate on how long

198
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:56,899
this line is. A foot? Okay.

[BREAK]

199
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,209
People who said a foot, what is it that

200
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,480
went through your head to figure it out?

[BREAK]

201
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,110
You imagined how long a... ruler is. This is

202
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,569
11 1/2 inches because it's an eight and a...

203
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:10,970
and it's 11 inches an 8 and a half by 11.

[BREAK]

204
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,180
But everybody in here has this category

205
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,610
in their head. Things that are kind of

206
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,910
the same length as a ruler. [BREAK] A continua of

207
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,009
length and there's a category for that.

[BREAK]

208
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:24,170
Suppose I'm telling you I have some

209
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,569
friend who's a runner, he runs the mile.

210
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,060
He's incredibly fast, in fact he's one of

211
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,709
the best runners in the country. At this

212
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:33,110
point, how fast does he have to have run

213
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,360
the mile, or better, for you to be deeply

214
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,630
impressed? [BREAK] Under four minutes. [BREAK] And thus we

215
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,910
have another categorical boundary there,

216
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,910
of, there's an infinite variety of speeds

217
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,339
with which you can run a mile, yet we

218
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,889
have in our heads this boundary... people

219
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,440
who are under 4 minute milers, you are

220
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,589
very impressed with. [BREAK] Okay, now I want to

221
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:55,970
impress you with another friend of mine

222
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,930
who's a painter

223
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,540
and this person is such a great painter

224
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,680
that they paint with 11 different colors.

[BREAK]

225
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,360
That doesn't work. Because that's not a

226
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,370
category that we have. We don't classify

227
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,279
the quality of it - hopefully not -

228
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,040
we don't classify quality of paintings

229
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,149
along those lines.

[BREAK]

230
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,579
But what we begin to see here is in the

231
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:19,910
right areas, we have categories that we

232
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,790
impose on things that are not

233
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,100
categorical. [BREAK] Here's an example. Why should

234
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,649
you do this when the example go here's

235
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,079
one of the classic continua that we ever

236
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,540
deal with, which is the continua of color,

237
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,850
the varying wavelengths that take the

238
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,949
rainbow from violet to red, and there's

239
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:38,990
an infinite number of spaces in between.

[BREAK]

240
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,930
And what do we do? We have rules in

241
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,389
English that you divide the continua

242
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,230
here,

243
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,410
and here, or whatever and that's what you

244
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,870
call a color. And this is red, everything

245
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,880
from here is red, everything here is

246
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,700
orange, so on. You take a continua

247
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,160
and you break it into boundaries. [BREAK] Why do

248
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,890
we do that? Because it makes it easier to

249
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,620
store the information away. [BREAK] Instead of

250
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,540
remembering the absolute features of

251
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,900
something you simply say "it's a." [BREAK] It's a

252
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,330
sub four-minute miler. It's a line

253
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,800
that's almost the length that's about

254
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,350
the length of the ruler. It's the color

255
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,480
orange. [BREAK] How do you know that's the case?

[BREAK]

256
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,610
Because go and take people from other

257
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,950
language groups where their language

258
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,560
arbitrarily divides the rainbow and

259
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,270
other points with completely different

260
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,940
color terms, and they remember different

261
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,090
profiles of colors differently than an

262
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,700
English speaker might. [BREAK] Take a color and

263
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,100
if the color comes right in the center

264
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,990
of somebody's a color categorization,

265
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,310
it comes right in the middle of the

266
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,170
range of what counts as that color,

267
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,690
people remember whether they saw that

268
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,000
color or not far better than if you

269
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
show them a color at the boundary.

[BREAK]

270
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,440
And people will show that as a function

271
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,910
of what language they speak.

[BREAK]

272
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,130
Taking a continua and you break it into

273
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,650
pieces because it's easier to deal with

274
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,020
the facts. [BREAK] Another example of it. Here we

275
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,530
have four objects and, as drawn here,

276
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,350
simply because we have categories to

277
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,570
describe the first three, do one of those

278
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,820
tests of "show people a bunch of shapes"

279
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,740
and they come back an hour later and ask

280
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,510
them have you seen the shape before and

281
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,220
people are going to be far more accurate

282
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,980
with this, than whether they saw this [odd shape], or

283
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,200
not because we don't have a word for it.

[BREAK]

284
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,150
We don't have a word that's at all sort

285
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,070
of analytical with some squiggly

286
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,140
whatever we don't have a clear-cut

287
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,560
category. Thinking in categories makes it

288
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,350
easier for us to remember stuff. And it

289
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,480
makes it easier for us to evaluate stuff.

[BREAK]

290
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,940
So that's a classic sort of response

291
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,370
that we have cognitively, to complicated

292
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,490
things. [BREAK] But there's a bunch of problems

293
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,850
with categorical thinking. [BREAK] First example,

294
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,690
and first one you can see from a realm of

295
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,880
language differences and that, not only

296
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,130
is there a continua of infinite number

297
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,500
of wavelengths, there's a continua of

298
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,100
sounds that humans can make.

[BREAK]

299
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,020
And different languages draw boundaries at

300
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,850
different points as to what count as

301
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,800
similar sounds or different sounds

302
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,680
There's like two different th sounds in

303
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,750
English which apparently we're not very

304
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,520
good at hearing but there's other ones

305
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,850
we are. [BREAK] And that will affect your ability

306
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,980
to remember stuff... what word it was?

[BREAK]

307
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,170
Depending on whether it is on a

308
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,970
dramatically different boundary, whether

309
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,220
it is sound that sounds different to you

310
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
or not. [BREAK] Example of this:

311
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,770
Apparently in Finnish, people do not

312
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,900
differentiate between the sound of a B

313
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,330
and the sound of the P, whereas we have

314
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,010
no trouble with that. But people from

315
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,840
Finland do not make that differentiation.

316
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,030
And I discovered this one day a number

317
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,610
of years ago where, for reasons I don't

318
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,830
even understand, I found myself needing

319
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,510
to take testicular biopsies on baboons.

[BREAK]

320
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,980
Not having, sort of, learned that in

321
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,780
junior high, how you do, that I called up

322
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,700
this guide urology at the med school who

323
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,190
happened to be Finnish and I explained

324
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,380
to him what I wanted to do and he sort

325
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,970
of took me through the paces and told me

326
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,910
what thingy I needed to buy and that

327
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,220
sort of stuff and holiday packages of

328
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,500
those where you can get a dozen. [BREAK] And sort

329
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,480
of telling me how to do that. And once we

330
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,400
went through, he said, what I want you to

331
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,800
do, the thing to do at this point is, get

332
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,480
some practice. [BREAK] I want you to practice on

333
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,720
a bear. [BREAK] What? [BREAK] He said yeah

334
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,840
practice on a bear. And I said, are you

335
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,940
kidding me? [BREAK] He said, I know, I know it

336
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,740
sounds crazy, but we have all the

337
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,150
residents do that, it's a very good

338
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,600
learning device, you know,

339
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,180
either... either practice on a bear or an

340
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,540
apple.

[BREAK]

341
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,100
Here we see the dangers of making

342
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,110
mistakes about differences between B and

343
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,440
P under certain circumstances.

[BREAK]

344
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,560
So, we see one of the dangers there, which is,

345
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,389
when you are paying too much attention

346
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,970
to categories, you can't differentiate

347
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,160
two facts that fall within the same

348
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,760
category. [BREAK] Next example: remember back at

349
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,889
various points of anxiety during exams

350
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:08,440
and such back-when, where there was a

351
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,410
world of difference between getting a 65

352
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,500
on a test and a 66 on a test, not

353
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,209
particularly different but because

354
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,100
there's this boundary drawn there

355
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,529
between passing and failing, there is

356
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,899
this dramatic differentiating we make.

[BREAK]

357
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:24,850
When you put a boundaries, you have

358
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,279
trouble seeing how similar things are on

359
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,060
either side of it. [BREAK] Next example: one

360
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,920
additional problem that you get when you

361
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,779
think categorically. [BREAK] And for this,

362
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,089
everybody needs to turn over one of the

363
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,470
pieces of paper, the paper you're gonna

364
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,360
hand in, the questionnaire, and what I'm

365
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,430
going to do is read you a series of

366
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,040
phone numbers, and I want you to write

367
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,390
them down as accurately as possible.

00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,359
no that doesn't count towards the grade -

378
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,419
what that will show, I'm sure, when, in some

379
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,699
obsessive burst of procrastination, I

380
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,199
actually look through the answers

381
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,660
tonight. [BREAK] What it's going to show is the

382
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,839
accuracy is going to tank the second you

383
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,549
go from the phone number pattern of

384
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:41,189
three digits followed by four, break up

385
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:43,559
that pattern, and suddenly we all get

386
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,239
screwed up because we're saying, wait a

387
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,499
second, I thought it was a phone number,

388
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:48,689
that was one digit, now two digits. I

389
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:50,579
can't... and it's gone, and you're on to the

390
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,220
next one. [BREAK] And, what we see there is the

391
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,949
third example, which is when you pay too

392
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,319
much attention to boundaries, you don't

393
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,759
see the big picture,

394
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,449
all you see are categories. [BREAK] All you see

395
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,339
are... wait a second, phone numbers are

396
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,449
supposed to come with three digits

397
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,510
followed by four. [BREAK] Another example of

398
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,459
where we use categorical thinking.

[BREAK]

399
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,289
Okay, I'm putting up a number series here.

400
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:27,179
Okay, what's... oh my God, okay what's the

401
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:35,100
next number in this series, and why? [BREAK] 42?

[BREAK]

402
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,149
How come?

[BREAK]

403
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,850
Okay, so we're kind of oscillating all

404
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,950
over the place there. [BREAK] Okay, so that's is

405
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,080
valid as anybody else's. [BREAK] Who else has a

406
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,800
next number in line there? What's that?

407
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:04,230
45? [BREAK] How come? [BREAK] Okay, are you going

408
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,010
to take that? 45? That's very... okay,

409
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,720
what else? [BREAK] Let me make it a little bit

410
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:19,260
easier here. [BREAK] Okay, so what's the next

411
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,120
number in that series? [BREAK] And what I'm

412
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,820
telling you is, if you think about the

413
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,100
world with a certain set of categories

414
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,650
in your head, you will know the next

415
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,090
number in the sequence. [BREAK] So what's the

416
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:40,250
next one? Seven billion. [BREAK] Okay, that one.

417
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,660
Okay, seven billion. [BREAK] That's another

418
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,150
possibility, although presumably it would

419
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,640
be seven billionth.

[BREAK]

420
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,590
Anything else? Any other guesses here as

421
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,600
to what happens next?

[BREAK]

422
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,060
4th, 14th, 23rd, 34th.

[BREAK]

423
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,410
What's the next one in the sequence?

[BREAK]

424
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,200
Yes, 44. How come?

[BREAK]

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,100
Okay, but remember, it's got to be 44th.

[BREAK]

426
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,660
What's that ordinal, cardinal whatever it is.

[BREAK]

427
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,580
What? [BREAK] [Audience]: 42nd? [BREAK] How come? [BREAK] [Audience]: Subway? You were right!

428
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,010
You were right! Anybody who's a New Yorker will

429
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,440
know what the next one is. These are the

430
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,990
subway stops. And you get a bagel with

431
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,530
cream cheese.

432
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,090
Just head it on back.

433
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,580
So, you get New Yorkers, and while

434
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,350
everybody else is thinking logical

435
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,770
things like 43 and 41 and 45 and 7

436
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,170
billion and all of that, you've got this

437
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,270
whole world of dividing numbers by

438
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,570
subway stops. [BREAK] We think in categories. We

439
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,820
think in categories. [BREAK] But as you just saw,

440
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,340
there are these problems. First one being...

441
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,640
when you think in categories, you

442
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,990
underestimate how different two facts

443
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,170
are when they fall in the same category.

[BREAK]

444
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,840
When you think in categories, you

445
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,370
overestimate how different they are when

446
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,870
there happens to be a boundary in

447
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,730
between them. [BREAK] And when you pay attention

448
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,400
to categorical boundaries, you don't see

449
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,250
big pictures. [BREAK] Now, what our goal in this

450
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,770
class is going to be is... think about this

451
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,870
big, complex issue of the biology of

452
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,510
behavior without falling into thinking

453
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,790
in categories. [BREAK] What do I mean in this

454
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,530
regard? Thinking categorically about a

455
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,040
subject like this. [BREAK] There's some chicken,

456
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,590
and the chicken is standing somewhere,

457
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,450
and there's some rooster over there

458
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,110
that does some sexually solicited,

459
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,090
exciting thing for the female. And in

460
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,920
response to that, the female picks up and

461
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,620
goes running over to the rooster. And thus,

462
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,690
we have our first behavioral biology

463
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,940
question here: why did that chicken cross

464
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,450
the road?

[BREAK]

465
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,850
To get to that rooster. [BREAK] So, you could

466
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,280
answer that like an endocrinologist and

467
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,140
say, well the female had certain levels

468
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,730
of estrogen in her bloodstream which

469
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,530
made its key hypothalamic areas

470
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,600
responsive to the stimulus. Or you could

471
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,880
answer it like an anatomist of saying,

472
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
well, because the fulcrum of a pelvis, or

473
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,320
whatever, it is chickens have that allow

474
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,660
them to run. Or you could answer it in

475
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,280
the category of an evolutionary

476
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,070
biologist that, over the millennia,

477
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,230
chickens that didn't respond to sexually

478
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,270
solicited gestures females left fewer

479
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,490
copies of their genes, and there's all

480
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,320
these different categories that we can

481
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,620
use to explain what's going on. All of

482
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,660
these different buckets. All of these

483
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,610
different buckets which begin to

484
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,500
pull you towards all of the problems we

485
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,470
just saw. [BREAK] Now having trouble telling how

486
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,720
different or similar two facts are,

487
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,270
having trouble seeing big pictures,

488
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,580
over emphasizing the importance of the

489
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,890
bucket you happen to live inside of, and

490
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,860
thus, suddenly everything about this

491
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,830
behavior is explained by a gene, a

492
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,460
neurotransmitter, a childhood trauma, a..., a...

493
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,429
living inside one bucket. [BREAK] What we're

494
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,289
going to be doing over and over in here

495
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,669
is the main point of the course, is

496
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:11,770
looking at how what goes on your body

497
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,230
influences behavior, emotions, memories.

498
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,480
How what goes on there influences your

499
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,460
body looping over, and at every one of

500
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,370
those points, resisting the pull to think

501
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,270
categorically: "Oh this is the explanation

502
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,970
for where this behavior came from." [BREAK] Here's

503
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,110
what we're going to be doing instead,

504
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,880
throughout, in terms of the structure of

505
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,679
the class. When we get to actual

506
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,190
behaviors for each behavioral category,

507
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,200
we will start off by looking at what the

508
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,809
behavior looks like, because often that

509
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,970
takes a lot more objectivity than we

510
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,799
initially assumed. [BREAK] What does the behavior

511
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,860
look like? Then we will say, well, what

512
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,470
went on in that organism a half second

513
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,929
before that behavior occurred, to occur?

514
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,539
To cause it to occur, which is the world

515
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,850
of what's going on with neurons... what's

516
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,610
going on with circuitry... where's the

517
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,159
explanation for the behavior? Aha, this

518
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,679
behavior happened because this part of

519
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,230
the brain got activated, but just as

520
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,909
we're about to settle happily into

521
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:12,279
that bucket, we push back a bit and say,

522
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,850
well, what smell, what sound, what sensory

523
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,429
stimulation in the environment caused

524
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:20,230
those neurons to get activated and

525
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,960
produce that behavior. [BREAK] And then, pushing

526
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,779
one step further behind, okay, well what

527
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,570
do hormone levels, various hormones in

528
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,279
the bloodstream of that animal or

529
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,409
individual for the past few hours,

530
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:34,390
how do those hormones change how

531
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,149
sensitive you are to those sounds, smells,

532
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,490
etc., that caused those neurons to get

533
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,140
activated and produce the behavior. [BREAK] And

534
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,240
all we're going to be doing is working

535
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,080
our way back all the way through early

536
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,419
development, fetal life, the genetic makeup

537
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,970
of an individual, the genetic makeup of

538
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,100
entire population, species, the

539
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,559
evolutionary pressure, on all the way

540
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,960
back to there... [BREAK] How do you explain each

541
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,360
one of these behaviors in the context of

542
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,399
those outposts? And, how are they not

543
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,279
really outposts? All they are are

543
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,370
different ways of expressing the same

545
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,399
biological influences. If you say ooh

546
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:13,110
here's a hormone that explains this

547
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,059
behavior, this behavior is caused by

548
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,690
hormone X. Hormone X is coded for by a

549
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,850
gene, so suddenly you're not just talking

550
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,950
about endocrinology, you're talking about

551
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,500
genetics, and if there's a gene there, it

552
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,840
has been the subject to selection, so

553
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,159
suddenly you're talking about evolution.

[BREAK]

554
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,220
If you were talking about what smell,

555
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,799
sights, etc, are the cue triggers for

556
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,230
behavior, by definition, you're also

557
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,330
talking about fetal development that

558
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,639
determined how sensitive those systems

559
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:44,070
were to those sorts of stimuli. [BREAK] What

560
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,750
we're going to be having over and over

561
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,149
again is any one of these buckets that

562
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:50,760
we spend some time in, all we're going

563
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,760
to do is think of that bucket is, at that

564
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,100
point, the most convenient way of

565
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,070
describing all of the influences that

566
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,440
came beforehand. [BREAK] And in that regard,

567
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,320
there's no buckets. All there are... are,

568
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,289
temporary platforms, and each platform is

569
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,470
simply the easiest, most convenient way

570
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,409
of describing the outcome of everything

571
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:15,419
that came beforehand, starting with

572
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,899
millennia back and evolution, okay.

[BREAK]

573
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:20,940
So that sounds great, that's what we're

574
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,830
gonna do. We're gonna do this, and we're

575
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,590
gonna be very sophisticated and fancy in

576
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,970
our thinking about it. And we're not going

577
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,919
to fall for categorical thinking, all

578
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,740
that. [BREAK] Okay, this is a complicated subject

579
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,389
and we're smart so we're gonna try to

580
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:35,639
think about that smartly. That's great,

581
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,440
but like, maybe this is just an

582
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,480
irritating song-and-dance here of "ooh

583
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,880
we're not gonna fall for categorical

584
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,580
thinking like people out there," obviously

585
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,080
when people are thinking about stuff

586
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,909
like behavior and they do this

587
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,789
professionally, professional biologist

00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:52,350
/biology/behavior type... yes and they

589
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,960
understand also. [BREAK] This is just the strawman

590
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,710
"ooh,

we're going to be more sophisticated in

interact and there's not just one

explanation and it's just the area they

597
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,289
focus on. They understand that. Let me

598
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,140
read you a few quotes to show just how

599
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,760
much some of these folks don't

600
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,890
understand that. [BREAK] First quote: Give me a

into anything I wish him to be, whether

605
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:33,330
doctor, lawyer, beggar, or thief. [BREAK] This was

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,419
John Watson in 1912. One of the founding

called Behaviorism. [BREAK] Behaviorism, that sort

609

Skinner in the 1950s, this notion that if

611
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,510
you could control the rewards, the

612
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,340
punishments, the positive, the negative

613
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,590
reinforcement, you could turn anybody

lawyer, beggar, or thief. [BREAK] And we know that

616
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:00,600
isn't the case. We know that's not

possible.

in one other factor, like a lot of

how wrong this guy was. [BREAK] You cannot have

turn somebody into whatever you want

out of academia for a wild scandal, but

633
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,190
he was involved in and he spent the rest

of his career apparently as an extremely

then modify the corresponding ideas and

force them into different channels. Using

person who started this and something

672
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:14,139
that was done to tens and hundreds of

00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,830
fix that one let me exterminate the

708
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,540
elements of the population loaded with

709
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,460
dregs and I'll fix up that little

710
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,050
problem with fixing something that ain't

711
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,840
broken who was this this was a scientist

712
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,350
named Konrad Lorenz. Konrad Lorenz he

713
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,790
probably a lot of us are familiar with

714
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,980
Konrad Lorenz was one of the founding

715
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,870
fathers of ethology we'll learn all

716
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,750
about that but he like everybody knows

717
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,430
him winding up in all the little kid

718
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,560
nature books Konrad Lorenz discovered

719
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,900
imprinting and birds and he'd be going

720
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,030
on he was this little Austrian guy with

721
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,190
this two big white beard and he'd always

722
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,990
have these little Austrian shorts and

723
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,850
suspenders and there would be a whole

724
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,710
bunch of duckies following him because

725
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,150
they thought he was mom and he was

726
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,910
totally charming and irresistible of

727
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,490
this sort of imprinting with his ducky

728
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,610
kids and he also happened to be a rabbit

729
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,820
Nazi propagandist who went to his grave

730
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,950
saying that there was nothing wrong with

731
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,920
what he did these are not crappy

732
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,740
fourth-rate scientists these are not

733
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,810
people working at you know the

734
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,540
University of the desert of podem or

735
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,970
whatever these are among the most

736
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,130
influential scientists of the last

737
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,040
century these are people who influenced

738
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,080
how people were educated and when we

739
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,970
decided it wasn't worth the effort of

740
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,400
doing it these are people whose

741
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,560
influence led to the brains being

742
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,780
destroyed of hundreds of thousands of

743
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,550
people who have nothing wrong with them

744
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,440
these are the people who led to the

745
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,600
notion that you fix up a problem that

746
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,850
doesn't exist by exterminating 9 million

747
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,300
people these are not minor scientists

748
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,620
these are the most

749
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,540
influential people in the last century

750
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,040
coming out of science in many ways

751
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,340
living pathologically inside their own

752
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,530
buckets and how they could explain the

753
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:30,430
entire world and thus again our goal is

754
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,309
going to be to not fall for that to

755
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,260
think about human behaviors and in some

756
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,180
cases to think about some of the most

757
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,920
disturbed motives some of the most

758
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,130
frightening damaged human behaviors and

759
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,380
resist the temptation to think inside a

760
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,680
bucket and find the explanation again

761
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,900
every level we're going to talk about

762
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,929
genes hormones neurons and fire mental

763
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,510
influence whatever it is that point will

764
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,730
simply be the easiest way of describing

765
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,520
all of the influences that came before

766
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,250
they're not even temporary buckets

767
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,880
there's no buckets that will be our goal

768
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,650
now thinking about this in approaching

769
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,750
human behavior the biology of human

770
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,670
social behavior often the biology of

771
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,679
abnormal humans human social behavior

772
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:16,960
we're gonna have three intellectual

773
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,260
challenges and the first one is

774
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,090
recognizing circumstances where there is

775
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,270
nothing fancy about us whatsoever we're

776
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,460
just like every other animal out there

777
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,250
and where the challenge is to accept

778
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,550
that let me give you an example you are

779
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,460
a hamster you are a female hamster and

780
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,890
you're sitting in your chair cage and as

781
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,510
a female hamster what you do is you

782
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,940
ovulate every 5 days or so and you're

783
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,110
going about your business and

784
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,600
everything's great now somebody puts

785
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,330
another female hamster in the cage with

786
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,700
you and over the subsequent month or so

787
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,670
what happens is both of you will begin

788
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,250
to lengthen your cycles and eventually

789
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,650
synchronize them so that you were both

790
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,230
ovulating the same afternoon on a

791
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,710
regular basis amazing this actually

792
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,860
works this way and menstrual ovulatory

793
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,659
synchrony people understand how this

794
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,610
works in hamsters it is done with

795
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,460
olfaction with pheromones with chemical

796
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,100
airborne signals from one female to

797
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,139
another and you can prove this by

798
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,480
electrically recording from olfactory

799
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,250
systems or if you don't have much

800
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,960
funding you could take like a paper clip

801
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,599
over the

802
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,460
female hamsters nose and she doesn't

803
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,109
synchronize then it's all done with

804
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,359
olfaction and what seemed most amazing

805
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:34,668
is you put the two females together and

806
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:37,728
there's a way of disrupting it put a

807
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:40,639
male hamster in there and suddenly the

808
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,799
cycles desynchronized and shortened and

809
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:45,649
you break it up with male pheromones and

810
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,929
what's even more remarkable is you put

811
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,029
the two females together and it's not

812
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:52,998
random who synchronizes the other one

813
00:34:52,998 --> 00:34:55,579
the dominant female synchronizes the

814
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:58,430
subordinate one totally understood

815
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,869
people have been working on this for

816
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:02,539
years and it works this way in-line

817
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:06,619
goats and sheep and dogs and cats and

818
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:09,349
pigs apparently you could go to a

819
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:12,380
7-eleven somewhere in Iowa and you could

820
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,710
buy a can of pig ovulatory

821
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,450
synchronization spray and take it home

822
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,339
and just run why I have no idea why you

823
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:21,769
would want to do that but nonetheless

824
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:24,650
that's how you like it's up there with

825
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,930
the cans of Cheez Whiz or whatever and

826
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,989
it's that well understood and what's

827
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:32,630
remarkable is it works exactly the same

828
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,019
way in us as humans where it is known as

829
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:39,650
the Wellesley effect the fact that over

830
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,140
the course of freshman year this was

831
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,079
first shown in Wellesley 1970 over the

832
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,930
course of freshman year women freshman

833
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,940
year roommate tended to lengthen and

834
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,849
synchronize their cycles and it was done

835
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,039
with olfaction women who had olfactory

836
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,140
deficits didn't synchronize with their

837
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,329
roommates they would synchronize unless

838
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:01,069
they were having close intimate

839
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:03,440
relationships with a male in which case

840
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,229
they D synchronize and what's most cool

841
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:08,509
of all is it's not random who

842
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:11,150
synchronizes to who the studies tend to

843
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,640
show is the individual who is more

844
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
socially outgoing extroverted dominating

845
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,559
is the one who synchronizes the other

846
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,150
one and this is well enough understood

847
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,489
that when Iowan in college people would

848
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:23,989
sit around the dinner table and say

849
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,969
stuff like oh when we roomed together in

850
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:27,739
the summer I had her synchronized by

851
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:29,819
August 1st

852
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:31,930
this is what happens if you hang out

853
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,690
with biologists but we're exactly the

854
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,999
same the challenge there is recognizing

855
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:39,009
there's nothing fancy about us at

856
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:41,259
various points in the class we will look

857
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:43,900
at comparisons between the human and the

858
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,900
chimp genome and it's virtually the same

859
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,910
some of the time we are just a plain old

860
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,479
off-the-rack animal second challenge is

861
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,640
going to be circumstances where we

862
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,220
appear to be just like everybody else

863
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,190
all the other organisms out there but we

864
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,380
do something very different with the

865
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,450
similarity let me give you an example

866
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,779
here you have two humans two individuals

867
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:10,479
who are going through a ritual they are

868
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,609
sitting at a table here absolutely

869
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:15,729
silent they're making no eye contact and

870
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:17,559
they do nothing more physically taxing

871
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,710
and every now and then one of them picks

872
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,569
up their hand and moves a little piece

873
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:25,059
of wood on the table and if these happen

874
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,460
to be the right two individuals in the

875
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,739
middle of a chess grandmaster tournament

876
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:32,499
these people are maintaining blood

877
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,869
pressure for six hours running that you

878
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:37,839
only see in a marathon runner these

879
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,999
people are going through thousands of

880
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:42,969
calories a day doing nothing more than

881
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,150
thinking and this is outrageous because

882
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,920
you look at one of these chess

883
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,200
grandmasters who's just taken down an

884
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,880
opponent and took their queen or

885
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,769
whatever and they will have the exact

886
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:56,469
same physiology as some male baboon on

887
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:58,059
the Savannah who's just to rip the

888
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:00,099
stomach open of his worst rival and

889
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:02,769
we're doing it there just with thought

890
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,019
and some of the time which mark allowed

891
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,460
us is we have absolutely typical boring

892
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,859
physiology but we use it in ways that no

893
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:14,950
other animal could we get stressed by

894
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,099
the inevitability of our mortality we

895
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:20,380
get stressed by reading something awful

896
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,599
let us happen to a child on the other

897
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,299
side of the planet we get stressed by

898
00:38:25,299 --> 00:38:28,180
somebody zooming past us in some sports

899
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,739
car and we decide that we are now

900
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,630
economically inadequate and you never

901
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,789
even see the person's face you just see

902
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,799
the car we get stressed reading about

903
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:36,810
something awful

904
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,750
happening to a character and a novel

905
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,110
this is a whole realm of things that we

906
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,910
could do that nobody else does and on

907
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,640
the flip side we can feel compassion and

908
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,610
empathy for a loved one but we can also

909
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,080
do the same for someone on the other

910
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,600
side of a planet and a refugee camp we

911
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,670
can feel compassion for a member of

912
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,580
another species we feel badly when our

913
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,160
pets are injured this is another realm

914
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,250
where the physiology of the response the

915
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,770
empathy the emotional bonding all of

916
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,320
that it's the same boring physiology as

917
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,390
every other animal out there and we are

918
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,350
using it in a way that is unrecognizable

919
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,090
now some of the time the challenge is

920
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,610
the third category which is when we are

921
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,950
doing something that no other animal out

922
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,470
there has anything remotely similar to

923
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,630
let me give you an example here a

924
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,200
shocking example you have a couple they

925
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,240
live together they come back at the end

926
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,340
of the day from work they talk the

927
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,650
dinner they talk some more they go to

928
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,330
bed and they have sex they talk some

929
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,000
more they fall asleep the next day they

930
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,880
do the same exact thing they come home

931
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,830
from work they talk they eat they talk

932
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,330
they go to bed they have sex they talk

933
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,730
some more they do this every single

934
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,710
night for 30 days running

935
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,490
hippos would be repulsed by this because

936
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,920
hardly anybody out there in the animal

937
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,500
kingdom has non-reproductive sex let

938
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,510
alone day after day and nobody else out

939
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,309
there talks about it afterward

940
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:08,799
what we've got here is a whole novel

941
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:11,529
domain of human being language use

942
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:14,709
aspects of our sexuality this profoundly

943
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:17,170
damaging human uniqueness of some

944
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,089
individuals confusing aspects of

945
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:21,729
sexuality with aggression in some cases

946
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:23,549
we are going to be out there on our own

947
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,829
trying to understand what's up okay so

948
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:28,869
that would be the general strategy for

949
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:31,359
the course we will resist categorical

950
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,799
thinking over and over and over and not

951
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:34,930
just because that's cool and nuanced and

952
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,209
subtle all of that but fall into

953
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:39,160
categorical thinking and you can do

954
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,099
unspeakable damage and a realm of silent

955
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,229
science that makes a difference we will

956
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:45,939
do so thinking constantly about

957
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:49,180
ourselves as a boring species just like

958
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,130
all the others out there as a species

959
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,709
that has the same boring physiology but

960
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:56,349
uses in ways that are unrecognizable as

961
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:58,509
a species that does some things that are

962
00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:00,809
simply without precedent out there and

963
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:03,609
constantly struggling with what does

964
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:06,459
biology have to do with it okay general

965
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,709
structure of the course the first half

966
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:11,619
of the course is going to be an overview

967
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,439
and introduction to the various buckets

968
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,929
the various categories and what we're

969
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:19,599
going to go through is understanding

970
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,119
sort of an introduction to evolutionary

971
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:25,239
theory an introduction to what molecular

972
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,609
genetics has to do with behavior the

973
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:31,109
behavioral genetics ethology the brain

974
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:33,699
endocrinology each of these buckets and

975
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,069
you know what happens next which is in

976
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:37,420
the second half of the course

977
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,640
we will look at specific behaviors and

978
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,339
in each case rip apart the buckets and

979
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:45,130
in each case do the strategy of what

980
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,140
does the behavior look like what

981
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,390
happened to second before the world of

982
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,429
neurons what happened with the sensory

983
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:53,859
stimuli that trigger those neurons etc

984
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:55,959
all the way back to the evolutionary

985
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:58,839
selective pressures so the first half of

986
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:00,189
the course is going to be the

987
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:02,079
introduction to the bucket and I will

988
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,150
tell you right off the bat it is a total

989
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,769
pain in the rear because of what we're

990
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:07,059
going to be doing is like every

991
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:09,189
two-and-a-half lectures just when you

992
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:10,869
were getting the vocabulary down we're

993
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,459
going to jump to a completely different

994
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:15,619
bucket it is going to be dizzying and

995
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,329
unpleasant and all of that and then

996
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:18,619
second half of the course

997
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,109
oh the rewards finally come of then

998
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:23,329
putting all the pieces together looking

999
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:25,960
at individual categories of behavior

1000
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,589
sexual behavior aggressive behavior

1001
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,839
parental behavior schizophrenia

1002
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:35,359
depression personality disorders

1003
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,460
language use in each of these cases

1004
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,369
what's going on a second before what's

1005
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:42,920
going on ten million years before where

1006
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,319
do all these buckets disappear in the

1007
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,930
interactions so that's going to be the

1008
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,569
strategy for the course something

1009
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,339
critical about how the course was

1010
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,829
designed is it's got no prerequisites

1011
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:57,650
because I really think this is a subject

1012
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,450
that everybody on earth should be forced

1013
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,400
to learn about at a gunpoint and thus

1014
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,559
like it's a good thing I think to have

1015
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:05,539
this not be one of those upper level bio

1016
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:07,160
classes let me just get a sense of who's

1017
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,469
here how many of you are bio types bio

1018
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:15,140
majors hum bio psychology anthro

1019
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,140
are there any English Lit grad students

1020
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:24,440
in here okay good for you thank you for

1021
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,589
coming see what you think in three

1022
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:29,900
months but nonetheless the class has

1023
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,239
been designed explicitly to have no

1024
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:34,640
background whatsoever how are we going

1025
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,769
to do that we're gonna do the usual song

1026
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:39,319
and dance of weekly sections and reviews

1027
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:41,150
and all that sort of thing but in

1028
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,219
addition during this first half of the

1029
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,200
course when we're jumping from category

1030
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,180
to category we're going to have each

1031
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,309
week additional sections a catch-up

1032
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:51,859
section which is for people who have no

1033
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:54,140
background in that area getting you

1034
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,119
through the basics and getting you up to

1035
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:58,430
speed so that you will be able to then

1036
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,229
know what's up during the lectures so

1037
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:02,660
those will be posted the first one of

1038
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,239
these is let me make sure I've got this

1039
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:08,450
yes it will be this Thursday at 7:30 in

1040
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,119
the room next door and this is going to

1041
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,980
be the introduction to of

1042
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,230
canary theory and getting you ready for

1043
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,630
what will be the evolution lectures

1044
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,090
Wednesday and Friday of this week if you

1045
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,160
don't have a strong background go to

1046
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,380
these catch-up sections the TAS who will

1047
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,930
be giving it are really expert in those

1048
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,930
areas lots of background and this will

1049
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,910
be your chance to catch up look through

1050
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,350
the handout I think I have a bunch of

1051
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,510
terms there or something where if you're

1052
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,280
not terribly familiar with those terms

1053
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,200
and some discipline that's a sign that

1054
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,000
you should probably go for some of the

1055
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,220
catch-up stuff if you really are just

1056
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,109
doing this sort of being very

1057
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:47,000
adventurous with no background if you

1058
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,310
can take it pass/fail that will take off

1059
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,350
a lot of the pressure as well because

1060
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,880
you could then actually pay attention to

1061
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,340
stuff here and the whole point here is

1062
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,740
to be able to do this even if you don't

1063
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,810
have a science background because the

1064
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,609
obvious argument I would make is

1065
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:03,500
everybody has to learn behavioral

1066
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,480
biology because we're being behavioral

1067
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,570
biologists every time we serve on a jury

1068
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,570
every time we vote whether or not money

1069
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,970
should be spent on solving some problem

1070
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,500
whether it's a problem whether it's

1071
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,869
solvable or not every time we try to

1072
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:19,820
make sense of a family member

1073
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,280
sunk in depression are they having a

1074
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,530
biochemical disorder or are they just

1075
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,970
indulging themselves

1076
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,070
we were behavior biologists all the time

1077
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,869
so it's a probably good thing that we'd

1078
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,150
be informed once so they catch up with

1079
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,490
these sections there take advantage of

1080
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,950
them what else we will have weekly

1081
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,170
sections the usual type people are not

1082
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,790
assigned to sections there's going to be

1083
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:43,190
I don't know 18 of them or so a week at

1084
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,800
various times go to whichever works for

1085
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,650
you there will be in midterm in the

1086
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,810
middle the midterm coming as we finish

1087
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,570
the last of those categories last of

1088
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,340
those buckets there will be a final

1089
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,530
there's no paper or anything like that

1090
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,290
so that will be the pattern what else

1091
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,020
other stuff here office hours my office

1092
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,720
hours are up on the handout other things

1093
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,750
breaks we will with any luck be able to

1094
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,270
we I with any luck we'll be able to be

1095
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,830
organized enough so that during each

1096
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,510
stretch of class there will be a

1097
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,100
five-minute break in the middle so you

1098
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,930
could stand up and just get to the front

1099
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:18,660
of the line for the

1100
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,430
Froome and then we will resume promptly

1101
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,070
before you get in there so just to let

1102
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,590
you clear your heads a bit assignments

1103
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,540
books reading there are two books that I

1104
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,960
have assigned for the course one is by

1105
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,720
me and you don't even have to read it

1106
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,080
just go buy a bunch of copies and bring

1107
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,850
me the receipt and you got a great grade

1108
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,350
in there okay so that's one's gonna be

1109
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,760
pertinent to the second half of the

1110
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,120
course we're going to give you a list of

1111
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,980
the chapters that make the most sense to

1112
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,500
read the other book is a book by an

1113
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,780
author named James Glick called chaos

1114
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,870
chaos year after year after year in this

1115
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,540
class provokes the strongest opinions a

1116
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,760
quarter of the people decided is the

1117
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,950
most irritating irrelevant thing that

1118
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,840
could possibly have been assigned in the

1119
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,090
class and hate it but half the people

1120
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,100
never quite figure out what's up with it

1121
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,740
and 1/4 of the people their life is

1122
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,260
transformed they no longer have to

1123
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,960
meditate they no longer have to have a

1124
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,830
book just they are at peace at peace I

1125
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,260
tell you because what this book does is

1126
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,200
introduce this whole radically different

1127
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,350
way of thinking about biology taking

1128
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,650
apart a world of reductionism for 500

1129
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:31,980
years

1130
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,110
we all have been using a very simple

1131
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,810
model for thinking about living systems

1132
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,150
which is if you want to understand

1133
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,670
something that's complicated you break

1134
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,310
it apart into its little pieces and once

1135
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,260
you understand the little pieces and put

1136
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,750
it back together you will understand the

1137
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,480
complex thing and what chaos as an

1138
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,820
entire field is about and this was

1139
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,320
pretty much the first book that was

1140
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,540
meant for the lay public about it what

1141
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,390
chaos shows is that's how you fix clocks

1142
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,940
that's not how you fix behaviors that's

1143
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,500
not how you understand behaviors

1144
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,650
behavior is not like a clock behavior is

1145
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,810
like a cloud and you don't understand

1146
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,090
rainfall by breaking a cloud down into

1147
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,190
its component pieces and gluing them

1148
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,410
back together so read through that book

1149
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,600
a lot of it is from physical sciences

1150
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,820
rather than biological so we'll just be

1151
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,940
suggesting the chapters you should read

1152
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,069
I will tell you it is the first book

1153
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:28,099
since like baby Beluga where I've gotten

1154
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:30,260
to the last page and immediately started

1155
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,910
reading it over again from the front

1156
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,730
because along with baby belugas had the

1157
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,920
greatest influence of my life I found

1158
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,319
this to be the most influential book in

1159
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:41,990
my thinking about science since college

1160
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:43,940
so that is a sign there will also be a

1161
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,069
bunch of lectures in the second half of

1162
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:47,960
the course covering these fields of

1163
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,140
chaos and complexity and if you really

1164
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,270
think about it it is going to force a

1165
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,160
change in everything else that you bring

1166
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,079
to thinking about this subject in

1167
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:00,230
addition at this moment there is not a

1168
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,060
reader because I'm trying to avoid

1169
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,829
having to get you guys to have to buy a

1170
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:06,290
reader I'm trying to redo all the

1171
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,300
assigned readings so that will just be

1172
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,400
from papers that are available online

1173
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,619
that you'll be able to download I'm

1174
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:14,240
about halfway through getting them there

1175
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,920
with any luck there will not have to be

1176
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,290
a reader but if it does exist it's not

1177
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,460
going to be big it won't be terribly

1178
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,040
expensive but there will be a bunch of

1179
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,130
readings online to download and it will

1180
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,800
vary in some cases it will be reading

1181
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,200
the whole paper in some cases I'll be

1182
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,300
suggesting you just read the abstract in

1183
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,670
some cases it will be to understand

1184
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,230
what's happening in the behave in the

1185
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,170
paper in detail in some cases this is an

1186
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,240
example of how people in this bucket

1187
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,700
think about this problem just read the

1188
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,369
abstract so all of that will be assigned

1189
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:48,470
and made clear what other stuff there's

1190
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,420
going to be a huge amount of information

1191
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,180
online the coursework is going to be set

1192
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,790
up for the class there will be copies of

1193
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,550
the handouts there will be lecture notes

1194
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,010
lecture notes that I have that will be

1195
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,470
about five to ten pages covering each

1196
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,420
lecture which will get to about the

1197
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,099
middle of the course and I suspect I

1198
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:09,470
will run out of steam by then so they

1199
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,940
won't care for the second half

1200
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,579
there will be commonly asked questions

1201
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,680
there will be a Q&A there will be course

1202
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,319
logistics some of the slides will be put

1203
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,599
up in there make use of that there will

1204
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:23,119
be announcements about time changing for

1205
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,550
office hours and things like that make

1206
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:27,680
you make use of that and people who are

1207
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,420
not formally enrolled we are figuring

1208
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,370
out a way for you to get access to it as

1209
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,590
well we've also made the decision that

1210
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,740
after this lecture the handouts will not

1211
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,730
be on paper and that is because by

1212
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,770
roughly for each lecture we will go

1213
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,440
through about 5,000 pieces of paper even

1214
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,900
double-sided all of the stuff will get

1215
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,450
posted on coursework the day before and

1216
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,070
if that's going to make it impossible

1217
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,440
for you to follow what happens in class

1218
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,510
because you are the last human on

1219
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,370
Stanford who is not living off of the

1220
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,380
computer screen come and talk to me and

1221
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,200
we will slip you an actual paper copy of

1222
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,050
the handouts most of them with any luck

1223
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,910
we can avoid using paper just because of

1224
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:09,800
how many people there are in here let's

1225
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,660
see other stuff sections sections will

1226
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,030
start this Thursday the regular sections

1227
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,890
all of those will be posted the times

1228
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,680
for that office hours won't start until

1229
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,760
next week a midterm will be in an

1230
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,680
evening rather than during a class time

1231
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,720
and if we're on schedule the class time

1232
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,940
that day it will be used for review and

1233
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,400
anything else Oh a very good suggestion

1234
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,410
just now given that the class before

1235
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,020
here is humongous and thus we have the

1236
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,270
impossible problem of a lot of people

1237
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,890
trying to get out of that while a lot of

1238
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,510
people are trying to get into that it

1239
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,640
might work best for everybody to come in

1240
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,190
from the top so that you flow down the

1241
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,650
stairs seamlessly and drive out those

1242
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,690
other people before us out the door

1243
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,660
there that might work a whole lot better

1244
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,790
final thing is we have a team of TAS

1245
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,880
here and they are great here they are

1246
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,370
TAS stand up and be embarrassed okay

1247
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:10,220
stand up those there they are there's

1248
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,040
all but one of them who is in transit

1249
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,230
there they are these guys are great they

1250
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,150
have either taken the course before in

1251
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,860
some cases they have T aid the course

1252
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,680
before their grad students in various of

1253
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,410
the bucket specialties I would strongly

1254
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,510
suggest taking advantage of the sections

1255
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,790
what will evolve after the first few

1256
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,730
weeks is there will be the regular

1257
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,230
sections going over the course material

1258
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:34,789
sort of the usual way

1259
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,380
there will also be more advanced

1260
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,179
sections for people who have stronger

1261
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:40,699
backgrounds take advantage okay you guys

1262
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,729
can sit down leaving them standing there

1263
00:52:43,729 --> 00:52:45,979
awkwardly for hours afterward take

1264
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:48,859
advantage of the sections really greatly

1265
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:52,219
skill TAS okay so that's basically what

1266
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:53,749
we got going here are there any

1267
00:52:53,749 --> 00:52:55,989
questions

1268
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,650
units okay somebody emailed without

1269
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,219
units the class is five units and it's

1270
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:06,319
because we are meeting for so many hours

1271
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,259
a week actually for a while the class

1272
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:11,359
was the sixth unit course and that was

1273
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,699
because of Condoleezza Rice because when

1274
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:16,069
she is the Provost here she totally

1275
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:18,349
screwed the biology department by upping

1276
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:20,989
our teaching requirements under really

1277
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:24,349
nasty conditions so what we all decided

1278
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:27,109
was to find ways every single sleazy

1279
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:29,089
trick we could do to puff up the number

1280
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:31,249
of units we were supposedly teaching so

1281
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,109
for a while the five unit class here we

1282
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,509
did do six units but eventually they

1283
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:37,339
caught us so we stopped doing that so

1284
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,369
first first she did that and then

1285
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:42,380
weapons of mass destruction so it's a

1286
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,439
five minute class at the moment say hi

1287
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:48,349
from me if you run into her on campus so

1288
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:52,130
five units the workload I think will be

1289
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,779
commensurate with that but it's mainly

1290
00:53:53,779 --> 00:53:55,789
because of heavy class time one

1291
00:53:55,789 --> 00:53:58,130
additional thing lectures are going to

1292
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,619
be tape and put up online within a day

1293
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:02,599
or so on coursework the reason for that

1294
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:04,759
is given that this spans two-hour block

1295
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:07,279
a lot of people have to miss one of the

1296
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:09,650
hour blocks and in the past it is work

1297
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,199
to be able to get the stuff up online so

1298
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:14,619
that will be advantageous for some folks

1299
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,599
okay question yes there was a question

1300
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,659
up there that was okay you take it back

1301
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:25,579
okay any other questions bagel guys did

1302
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:26,959
you get your bagel or did somebody eat

1303
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:31,400
it okay good good and the social

1304
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,920
contract comes through yep

1305
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:42,260
what's up yes I don't remember

1306
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:47,160
May 3rd May 3rd for the midterm 7:30 in

1307
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,319
the evening it is a Monday June 4th for

1308
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:59,230
the final ok more questions yeah

1309
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,450
what's the format of the midterm in the

1310
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:05,079
file in an ideal world given the whole

1311
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:07,420
emphasis here on no buckets blah blah

1312
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,210
etc it would be long essays and

1313
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,339
requirements of sonnets and sensitive

1314
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:15,280
haikus about the hypothalamus but simply

1315
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,810
because in the numbers and here we are

1316
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,000
reduced to sort of like lowest common

1317
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,930
denominator

1318
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,480
a lot of multiple-choice questions just

1319
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,790
to make things saner for the TAS because

1320
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:27,099
it is an unbelievable job to try to

1321
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:29,280
engrave this many papers that quickly

1322
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,599
broadly intellectually what the midterm

1323
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,550
is going to be about is just touching

1324
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:36,190
base making sure you understand the

1325
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,200
basics of each of those buckets each of

1326
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,359
those disciplines a little bit of

1327
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:42,310
forcing you to think across disciplines

1328
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,320
what the final is going to be entirely

1329
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,200
about is forcing you to think across the

1330
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,570
disciplines across the buckets there so

1331
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:50,560
it's going to be so very different

1332
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,920
intellectual foci in their mid term have

1333
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,540
the facts that hopefully it won't be

1334
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,280
quite as mindless is that but that's the

1335
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,380
main function of the midterm okay more

1336
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,890
questions yep

1337
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,140
okay th did you guys decide to videotape

1338
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:18,880
the ketchup section audio okay that okay

1339
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,680
either office hours or it's going to be

1340
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,810
taped and put up online and of course

1341
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,360
works and if there's critical handouts

1342
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,610
visuals those will be posted there as

1343
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:36,830
well good more questions yeah yes and

1344
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,630
it's gonna be for each it's going to be

1345
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:41,530
in advance of the next three lectures

1346
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:47,630
since young final is at 7:30 for two

1347
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,450
hours the fine of all of the final of

1348
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:57,130
the final five fifteen twelve fifteen

1349
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,390
just to get that up there

1350
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:09,250
twelve fifteen more questions any are
