1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,200
Stanford

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,760
University often asked question what's

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,000
the difference between bio 150 bio 250

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,080
and is it humbio

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,480
160 no difference it's exactly the same

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,160
so like the same requirements same units

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,320
so take whichever one makes your life

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
easiest let's see any other procedural

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,119
stuff well the answer are back from

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,719
Monday's

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,559
questionnaire and a uh variety of

12
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,280
interesting answers not surprisingly

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,520
given the size of a group why have you

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
taken this course uh really want to know

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,079
about animal behavior but willing to

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,360
deal with

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,840
humans uh because I'm substituting it

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,559
for Bio 43 which I don't want to

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,120
take my dad used to make me read books

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,760
about human behavior in biology is

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,120
punishment that doesn't make any sense I

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,079
know one of the TA so I figure that

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,840
guarantees me an

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
A okay guys it's in New York Court uh

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
one I really liked because I want to be

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,880
a filmmaker after college yay

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,840
interdisciplinary um what else my first

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,840
grade teacher is making me Tom mcfaden

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,240
told me

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,439
to I'm a hyper oxygenated diletant um I

31
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,479
wanted to somewhat correctly pointing

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,640
out why have you taken this class I

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,920
haven't taken it yet a number of people

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,520
reporting that in fact that was the

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,040
correct answer and my favorite why have

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
you taken this course

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640
yes

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
okay relevant background relevant

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,000
background I'm human I'm human and I

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,880
often behave I'm human and I have

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,360
biology uh 19 years of being confused

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,920
about human behavior uh not really sort

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,360
of uh seeing crazy behavior as an RA and

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,759
an all Frost dorm and I date a

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,000
biologist let's see there was also the

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,680
question on there of did the thing on

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,199
the board look more like an A or a b and

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,840
just to really facilitate that one I

49
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,680
forgot to put the A and the B up um but

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,519
that Taps into a cognitive something or

51
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:17,959
other which maybe I'll get back to at

52
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,160
some point telephone numbers reading

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,120
them off accuracy dramatically tanked as

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,840
soon as the three number four number

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,080
Motif went down the tubes and when it

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,319
came back briefly accuracy came back a

57
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,680
little bit

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,640
finally uh let's see all of you guys

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,480
conform to a standard frequent gender

60
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,720
difference which is everybody was

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,879
roughly equally by gender roughly

62
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,480
equally likely to see dependent as the

63
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,599
opposite of independent a small minority

64
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,239
went for inter

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
interdependent um however one finding

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,440
that has come up over and over is that

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
far more females are interested in peace

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
than males males are more interested in

69
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,599
Justice okay have you taken the bio core

70
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,239
quote no way Jose uh somebody pointing

71
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:07,920
out quite correctly don't settle for

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
peace or Justice then of course there

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
was the person who responded to that

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,200
question by writing those words are just

75
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,159
symbols need to know assumed

76
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,840
meeting

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,239
okay uh there was one questioner that

78
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,760
was carefully signed and something

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,400
approaching calligraphy it was so

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,239
beautiful and was otherwise blind

81
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,920
uh for years running the course the uh

82
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,080
subject that most people really want to

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,879
hear and most people really don't want

84
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,120
to hear is about the biology of

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,400
religiosity and for 22 years running now

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
Stanford students are more interested in

87
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,959
depression than sex okay so we start off

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,560
I keep telling Hennessy about this but

89
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,280
nothing gets done okay we start off we

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,720
start off if I can open this

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,920
which is something you could do if you

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,599
have a certain type of training if

93
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,079
you're some osteologist or whatever

94
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,840
these folks are called if you are

95
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,079
presented those two skulls and told this

96
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,560
one's a female this one's a male you can

97
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,440
begin to figure out stuff like how heavy

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,360
how large the body was of that

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,080
individual what diseases they had had

100
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,919
they undergone malnutrition had they

101
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,600
given birth a lot of times a few times

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,199
were they bipedal all sorts of stuff you

103
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,520
could figure out from just looking at

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,440
these skulls what today's lecture and

105
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,840
Friday's is about is the fact that with

106
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,880
the right tools under your belt you

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
could look at these two skulls and know

108
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
that information you're a field

109
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
biologist and you've discovered this

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
brand new species and you see that this

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,360
one nurses an infant shortly before

112
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,039
leaping out of the tree leaving only the

113
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,919
skull and this one has a penis shortly

114
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,479
before leaving leaping out of the tree

115
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,520
and leaving leaving a skull so all you

116
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,800
know is this is an adult female and

117
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,840
adult male and if you've got the right

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,919
tools there you can figure out who's

119
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,199
more likely to cheat on the other is the

120
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,520
female more likely to mess around or is

121
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,800
the male how high are the levels of

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
aggression does the female tend to have

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,280
twins or one kid at a time do females

124
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,039
choose males because they have good

125
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,400
parenting skills or because they're big

126
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,880
hunky guys what levels of differences in

127
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,240
life expectancy do they live the same

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,639
length of time you would be able to tell

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,039
whether they have the same life

130
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,400
expectancy or if there's a big

131
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,440
discrepancy between the two all sorts of

132
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,800
stuff like that merely by applying a

133
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,639
certain piece of logic that dominates

134
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,600
all of this okay so you're back reading

135
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,479
those time life nature books back when

136
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,000
and there was always a style of thing

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,639
you would go through which is they

138
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
describe some species doing something

139
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
absolutely Ely amazing and unlikely and

140
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,639
it go like this the giraffe the giraffe

141
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,000
has a long neck and it obviously has to

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,520
have a big heart to pump all that blood

143
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,639
up there and you lock up a whole bunch

144
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,319
of biomechanics people with you know

145
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,360
slide rules and out they come out with

146
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,400
this prediction as to how big the

147
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,639
giraffe heart should be and how thick

148
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
the walls and you go and you measure a

149
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
giraffe heart and it's exactly what the

150
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,960
equations predicted and you say isn't

151
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,599
nature amazing or you read about some

152
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,120
like desert rodents that drink once

153
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,479
every three months and another bunch of

154
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,400
folks have done math and figured out

155
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,800
like how many miles long the renal

156
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,319
tubules have to be and somebody goes and

157
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,720
studies it and it's exactly as you

158
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,080
expect it isn't nature wonderful no

159
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,160
nature isn't wonderful you couldn't have

160
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,120
giraffes unless they had hearts that

161
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,160
were that big you couldn't have rodents

162
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,759
living in the desert unless they had

163
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,879
kidneys that worked in a certain way

164
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,680
there is an inevitable logic about how

165
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,319
organisms function how organisms are

166
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,440
built how organisms have evolved solving

167
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,199
this problem of optimizing a solution

168
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,160
and what the next two lectures are about

169
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,199
is you can take the same exact

170
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,680
principles and apply them to thinking

171
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,720
about the evolution of behavior the same

172
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,879
sort of logic where just as you could

173
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,039
sit there and with logical principles

174
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,800
come to the point of saying a giraffe's

175
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,039
heart is going to be this big you can go

176
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,000
through a different realm of logic built

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
around evolutionary principles and

178
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,319
figure out all sorts of

179
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,160
aspects of social behavior and we

180
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,680
already know what's involved in say

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,960
optimizing what's the optimal number of

182
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
whatever is in your kidney what's the

183
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,639
optimal Behavior strategy or something

184
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,720
all of us as soon as we got like some

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,080
kid sibling learned how to do the

186
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,319
optimal strategy and Tic-tac-toe and so

187
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,800
that you could never lose and it's

188
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,039
totally boring but that's a case of

189
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,599
figuring out the optimal solution to

190
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,240
behavior reaching what is called the

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,159
Nash equilibrium and actually I have no

192
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,039
idea what I just said but I like making

193
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
reference to Nash because it makes me

194
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,720
feel quantitative or something so that

195
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,120
is called the Nash equilibrium the Nash

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,159
equilibrium and what the entire Point

197
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,879
here is the same sort of process of

198
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,120
figuring out what are the rules of

199
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,199
optimizing Tic Tac Toe Behavior can be

200
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,599
built upon the principles Evolution to

201
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,319
figure out all sorts of realms of

202
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,839
optimized social behavior and broadly

203
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,120
this is a field that's known as

204
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,799
sociobiology emerging in the late 1970s

205
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,958
mid 1970s or so and by the late 1980s

206
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,160
giving birth to another discipline known

207
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,040
as evolutionary psychology the notion

208
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,000
that you cannot understand behavior and

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
you cannot understand internal

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,959
psychological States outside the context

211
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,959
of evolution had something to do with

212
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,440
sculpting those behaviors and those

213
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,440
those psyches so to start off with that

214
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,560
basic song and dance about Darwin just

215
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,040
to make sure we're up to speed on this

216
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,240
Darwin just to get some things out of

217
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
the way Darwin did not discover

218
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,240
Evolution people knew about Evolution

219
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,600
long before that Darwin came up with the

220
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,720
notion of a mechanism for evolution

221
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,680
natural selection and in fact Darwin is

222
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,279
the inventor of that there was another

223
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,440
guy Alfred Russell Wallace the two of

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,279
them and for some reason Wallace has

225
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,120
gotten screwed historically and Darwin

226
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
gets much more attention but starting

227
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,079
off with a darwinian view of how

228
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:36,880
Evolution works first thing being that

229
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,279
there is evolution traits in populations

230
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,880
change over time traits can change

231
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,839
enough that in fact you will get

232
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,120
speciation new species will form and the

233
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,519
logic of darwinian evolution is built on

234
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,480
just a few couple of very reasonable

235
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
steps first one is that there are traits

236
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,959
that are heritable

237
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,959
traits that could be passed on one

238
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,360
generation to the next traits that we

239
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,200
now can translate in our modern

240
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,240
paraments into traits that are genetic

241
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,399
and we will see soon how that's totally

242
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,519
not correct to have said that but traits

243
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,440
that are

244
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,120
heritable the next thing is that there

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
is variability among those traits

246
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,440
there's different ways in which this

247
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,839
trait can occur and they're all

248
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,360
heritable the next critical thing some

249
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,920
versions of those traits are more

250
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,279
adaptive than others some versions work

251
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,200
better for you for example giraffe who

252
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
wind up with hearts the size of like a

253
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,839
tomato that's not an optimal version

254
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,839
amid the range of variability some will

255
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,519
carry with them more Fitness more

256
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,720
adaptiveness than others and that

257
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,480
translates into another sound bite

258
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,560
that's got to be gotten rid of all of

259
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
this is not about survival of the most

260
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,000
adapted it's about reproduction of

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,800
something we will come to over and over

262
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
again it's about the number of copies of

263
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
genes you leave in the next Generation

264
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,519
so you've got to have traits that are

265
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,920
heritable there's got to be variability

266
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,600
in them some of those traits are more

267
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
adaptive than others some of those

268
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
traits make it more likely that that

269
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,760
organism passes on copies of its genes

270
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,120
into the Next Generation and throw those

271
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,320
three pieces together and what you will

272
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,560
get is evolution in populations changing

273
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,120
frequencies of traits and when you throw

274
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,680
in one additional piece which is every

275
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,160
now and then the possibility to have a

276
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,560
random introduction of a new type of

277
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,320
trait in there modern parland a mutation

278
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,279
from that you could begin to get actual

279
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,839
large changes in what a population looks

280
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,279
like okay so these are the basic

281
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,480
building blocks of Darwin and it is easy

282
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,760
to apply to giraffe's hearts and kidneys

283
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,959
of Desert Rats and everything we think

284
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,360
about in the world of physiology Anatomy

285
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,120
in the context of evolution so how do

286
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,800
you apply it to behavior and the basic

287
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,720
notion for folks who want to come from

288
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
this Darwin in Tradition into thinking

289
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,600
about behavior is you do the exact same

290
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,800
thing there are behaviors that are

291
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,560
heritable types traits classes of

292
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
behaviors they come with a certain

293
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
degree of variation among individuals

294
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,839
some versions of them are more adaptive

295
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,560
than others over time the more adaptive

296
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,959
versions will become more commonplace

297
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,519
and every now and then you can have

298
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,440
mutations that introduce new variability

299
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,600
totally logical absolutely unassailable

300
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,399
and what we're going to spend an insane

301
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,000
amount of time in this class on is one

302
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,920
simple assumption in there which is that

303
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
certain behaviors are heritable that

304
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
certain behaviors have genetic

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
components and as you'll see this one is

306
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,480
just going to run through every lecture

307
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,440
wrestling with that issue there this is

308
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,399
a big incendiary issue there as to how

309
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,480
genetic and that's not the same thing as

310
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,800
saying how genetically determined how

311
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,519
genetic behavior is okay so that's going

312
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,199
to be a issue we come back to again and

313
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:13,079
again so now transitioning into how you

314
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,639
would apply these darwinian principles

315
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,440
first thing before starting a caveat

316
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,959
you're going to wind up in order to

317
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,240
think about all of this most efficiently

318
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,120
hopefully do some personifying

319
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,320
personifying as in you'll sit around and

320
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,959
saying well what would a female

321
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,680
chimpanzee want to do at this point to

322
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,120
optimize the number of copies of her

323
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
jees in the Next Generation what would

324
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
this brine shrimp want to do to deal

325
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,639
with this environmental stressor what

326
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,639
would this you know cherry tree do

327
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,199
they're not planning they are not

328
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,760
conscious they're not taking classes in

329
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,040
evolutionary biology what would this

330
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,360
organism want to do is just a shorthand

331
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
for something sculpted by the sort of

332
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,160
exigencies of evolution and producing

333
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,800
the optimal they wanted do this this is

334
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,959
just going to be a shorthand throughout

335
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,399
once you get past the Apes nobody is

336
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
wanting to do any of these optimization

337
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,079
things so just getting that sort of

338
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,920
terminology out of the way okay so we

339
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,120
start off with what's the first building

340
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,920
block of applying darwinian principles

341
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,240
to behavior something that is absolutely

342
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,920
critical to emphasize because the first

343
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,199
thing we all need to do is unlearn

344
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,519
something we all learned back when on

345
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,000
all those National Geographic specials

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,199
and that would consist instantly teach

347
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:31,759
us something about this aspect of

348
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,639
evolution and would always teach it to

349
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,720
us wrong here's the scenario so you're

350
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,399
watching and there's this Wildlife

351
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,800
documentary it's it's Dawn on the

352
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
Savannah and you see there's a whole

353
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
bunch of lions on top of some big old

354
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
dead thing some Buffalo or something and

355
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,079
they're chewing away and having a fine

356
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,880
time so something happens at that point

357
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,120
which is they have to deal with how they

358
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,759
divvy up the food or let me give you

359
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,279
another example another standard sort of

360
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,720
endless vignette that comes up in these

361
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,279
films once again now you're back on the

362
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,360
Savannah it's not dawn this time but you

363
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,320
are looking at one of the Magnificent

364
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,759
things of the natural world which is the

365
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,040
migration of zebras throughout East

366
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,160
Africa a herd of two million of them

367
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
migrate around following a cyclical

368
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,600
pattern of rains so they're always going

369
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
where the grass is greener so you've got

370
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,079
this wonderful herd of 2 million

371
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,600
wilderbeast and there's a problem which

372
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,759
is there's some great field right in

373
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,560
front of them full of grass and bummer

374
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,319
there's a river in between them in the

375
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,040
next field and especially a bummer a

376
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,680
river teaming with crocodiles just ready

377
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,000
to grab them so what are the wilderbeast

378
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,519
going to do and according to the

379
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,519
National Geographic type specials we

380
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,600
would get out would come a solution

381
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,720
there's all the wilderbeast hemming and

382
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,279
ha in this agitated state by the end

383
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,800
edge of the river and suddenly from the

384
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,279
back of the crowd comes this elderly

385
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,720
wilderbeast who pushes his way up to the

386
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,480
front stands on the edge of the river

387
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,240
and says I sacrifice myself for you mind

388
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,040
Kinder and throws himself into the river

389
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,319
where immediately the Crocs get busy

390
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:16,160
eating him up and the other two million

391
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,680
wilderbeast could tiptoe around the

392
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
other way across the river and

393
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,680
everybody's fine and you're then saying

394
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,120
why' this guy do this why did this guy

395
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,040
fling himself into the river and we

396
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,519
would always get the answer at that

397
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,399
point the answer that is permeated as

398
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,120
like the worst Urban myth of evolution

399
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,680
whatever why did he do that because

400
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,680
animals behave for the good of the

401
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,279
species this is the notion that has to

402
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,120
be completely trashed right now animals

403
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,360
behaving for the good of the species

404
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,240
really came to the Forefront a guy in

405
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,720
the early 60s named win Edwards

406
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,639
hyphenated win Edwards some hyphenated

407
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,880
Brit zoologist Who pushed most strongly

408
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,240
this notion of of that animals behave

409
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,079
for the you know good of the species he

410
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,039
is reviled throughout every textbook wi

411
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,839
Edwards and group selection that would

412
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,079
be the term selection for the good of

413
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,839
groups for the selection for the good of

414
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,039
the species win Edward and group

415
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,359
selection I'm sure the GU did all sorts

416
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,000
of other useful things and anyone who

417
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
really is has any depth to them would

418
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,720
find out but all I know is that the guy

419
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,240
is the one who came up with group

420
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,359
selection animals behave for the good of

421
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,640
the species

422
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,320
this isn't the case at all animals

423
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,400
behave for passing on as many copies of

424
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,880
their genes as possible and what we'll

425
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,960
see is when you start looking at the

426
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,840
nuances of that sometimes it may look

427
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,520
like behaving for the good of the

428
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,000
species but it really isn't the case so

429
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,320
animals behave in order to maximize the

430
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,960
number of copies of genes they leave in

431
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,320
the next Generation remember not surviv

432
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,760
with the fittest reproduction to the

433
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,400
fittest so first thing you need to to do

434
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,360
is go back to that vignette and saying

435
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,039
uh so what's up with the wilderbeast

436
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,799
there and what's up with the elderly guy

437
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,679
who jumps in the river and finally when

438
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,480
you look at them long enough instead of

439
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,760
the camera crew showing up for 3 minutes

440
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,799
when you study this closely enough you

441
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,880
see something that wasn't Apparent at

442
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880
first which is this elderly wilderbeast

443
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,720
is not fighting his way through the

444
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,440
crowd this guy is being pushed from

445
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,559
behind this guy is being pushed from

446
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,200
behind because all the other ones are

447
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,120
saying yeah yeah get the old guy on The

448
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,000
River sacrificing himself my ass this

449
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
guy is getting pushed in by everybody

450
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,360
else he is not sacrificing himself for

451
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,320
the good of the species he does not like

452
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,360
the idea of this whatsoever so he gets

453
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,480
pushed in because the old weak guy none

454
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,960
of this group selection stuff what came

455
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,960
in by the 70s as a replacement a way to

456
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,480
think about this is this notion of

457
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,159
animals including us behaving not for

458
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,640
the good of the species of the group but

459
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,799
to maximize number of copies of genes

460
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,600
left in the Next Generation and what you

461
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,039
see is three ways in which this could

462
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,880
occur three building blocks the first

463
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,000
one being known as individual selection

464
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,120
the first one built around the notion

465
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,640
that sometimes the behavior of an animal

466
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,840
is meant to optimize the number of

467
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,679
copies of its genes that it leaves in

468
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
the Next Generation by itself

469
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,280
reproducing the drive to reproduce the

470
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,120
drive to leave more copies of one's

471
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,480
genes this was one summarized really sort

472
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,840
of tersely as sometimes a chicken is an

473
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,960
egg's way of making another

474
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,840
chicken. No, that's backwards.

475
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,159
Sometimes a chicken is an egg's way of

476
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,240
making another egg. Okay, ignore that

477
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,159
sometimes what the guy said is sometimes

478
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:51,200
a chicken is an egg's way of making

479
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
another egg. All this behavior stuff and

480
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,080
all this animate sort of social

481
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,720
interaction is just an epiphenomenon to

482
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,280
get more copies of the genes into the

483
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,679
next generation. Individual selection a

484
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,080
subset of way of thinking about this is

485
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,360
selfish genes what behavior is about is

486
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
maximizing number of copies of genes in

487
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,280
the next generation and sometimes the

488
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,159
best way to do it sometimes the way that

489
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,720
animals maximize is to get as many

490
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,400
copies by way of reproducing themselves.

491
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,280
It's not quite equivalent to a selfish

492
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,120
gene but for our purposes individual

493
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,520
selection.

494
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,200
and this can play out in a number of

495
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,720
Realms and bringing in sort of a big

496
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,039
dichotomy and thinking about

497
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,240
evolutionary pressures Darwin and the

498
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,039
theory of natural selection what natural

499
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,080
selection is about is processes bringing

500
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,200
about an organism who is more adaptive

501
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,240
what we just went through. Darwin soon

502
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,120
recognized there was a second realm of

503
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
selection which he called sexual

504
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,880
selection and what that one's about is

505
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,200
this is selecting for traits that have

506
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,520
no value whatsoever ever in terms of

507
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,880
survival or anything like that traits

508
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,360
that carry no adaptive value but for

509
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,400
some random, bizarro reason the opposite

510
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,720
sex likes folks who look this way so

511
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,360
they get to leave more copies of their

512
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,400
genes and suddenly you could have

513
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,039
natural selection bringing about big

514
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,960
sharp antlers and male moose and they

515
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,000
use that for fighting off Predators or

516
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,559
fighting with the male that would be

517
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,640
natural selection sexual selection might

518
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,400
account for the fact that like the

519
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,159
antlers or green paisley patterns all

520
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,679
over for that and for some reason that

521
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,919
looks cool to female moose mooses and

522
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,640
what you wind up getting as a mechanism

523
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,679
for sexual selection is as long as

524
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:44,840
individuals prefer to mate with

525
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,000
individuals with some completely

526
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,159
arbitrary traits those traits will also

527
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,360
become more common so this dichotomy of

528
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,159
natural selection for traits driven by

529
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,559
traits that really do Aid leaving copies

530
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,919
of genes outside the realm of just sheer

531
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,840
sexual preference sexual selection and

532
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,240
sometimes they can go in absolutely

533
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,600
opposite directions you can get some

534
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,600
species where the female fish prefer

535
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,480
male fish that have very bright

536
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,919
coloration and that's advantageous then

537
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,440
to have the bright coloration by means

538
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,360
of sexual selection but the bright

539
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,080
coloration makes you more likely to get

540
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
predated by some other fish natural

541
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,440
selection pushing against bright

542
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,880
coloration in males very often often

543
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,600
you've got the two going against each

544
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,320
other having to balance so how would

545
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,360
that be applied in this realm of

546
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,960
individual selection this first building

547
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,120
block sometimes an egg damn sometimes a

548
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,480
chicken is an egg's way of making

549
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,440
another egg sometimes what behavior is

550
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,720
about is one individual trying to

551
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,240
maximize the number of copies of their

552
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,520
genes in the Next Generation a natural

553
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,720
selection manifestation of it being

554
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,400
you're good at running away from

555
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,480
predators selection for speed for

556
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,360
certain types of muscle metabolism for

557
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,919
certain sensory systems that will tell

558
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:05,080
you there's somebody scary around that

559
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,960
would be the realm of that. Individual

560
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,799
selection selecting in the realm of

561
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,720
sexual selection to have more of

562
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,279
whatever those traits are that are

563
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,279
attractive so this first building block

564
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,880
it's not group selection it's not

565
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,600
behaving for the good of the species

566
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,320
it's behaving to maximize the number of

567
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,720
copies of one's genes in the Next

568
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,679
Generation and the most straightforward

569
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,400
way is to behave in a way to maximize

570
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,240
the number of times you reproduce

571
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,640
yourself second building block which is

572
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,799
there's another way of accomplishing the

573
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,760
same thing that you just did with

574
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,840
individual selection as follows one of

575
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,600
the things that could be relied upon in

576
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,679
life is that you are related to your

577
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,240
relatives and what you get is the more

578
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,919
closely related you are the more genes

579
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:52,960
you share in common with them on a

580
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,799
statistical level identical twins share

581
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,559
100% of their genes full siblings 50%

582
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:02,159
half siblings 25% this is exactly

583
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,440
something that's going to be covered in

584
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
the catchup section this week if you're

585
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,120
not comfortable with this stuff, this

586
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,679
sort of thing will be reviewed in more

587
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:11,720
detail okay so the closer a relative is

588
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,520
to you the more copies... the more

589
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,880
genes they share in common with you. So

590
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,919
suddenly you've got this issue you're an

591
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
identical twin and your identical

592
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,880
sibling has the same genes that you do

593
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,960
individual selection you will be just as

594
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,080
successful as passing on copies of

595
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,640
your genes into the next generation if

596
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,360
you forego reproducing to make it

597
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,480
possible for your identical twin to do

598
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,399
so because on a level of just sheer

599
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:42,360
numbers of copies of genes in the Next

600
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,679
Generation they are equivalent and

601
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,799
sometimes you will thus get behavior

602
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,559
which really decreases the reproductive

603
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,039
success of an individual in order to

604
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,880
enhance the success of a

605
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,120
relative but you've got a constraint

606
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,440
there which is all of your relatives

607
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,760
don't share all your genes with you they

608
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,960
have differing degrees of relatedness

609
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,120
and what that winds up producing is

610
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,279
another Factor another observation one

611
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,640
of the great like witty geneticists of

612
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,600
all time a guy named haldane who

613
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,520
apparently once in a bar was trying to

614
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,440
explain this principle to somebody and

615
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,039
came up and said I will gladly lay down

616
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,440
my life for two brothers or eight

617
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,279
cousins and that's the math of the

618
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,399
relatedness you passing on one copy of

619
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,880
your genes to the next generation is

620
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,880
from the sheer mathematics of just how

621
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,760
evolution is going to play out over the

622
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,120
generations is exactly equivalent as

623
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,120
giving up your life for eight cousins to

624
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,159
be able to each pass on a copy of their

625
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:47,360
genes because you share 1/8 with each of

626
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,399
them and it winds up being a whole or

627
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,679
and it's that math and out of that you

628
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,919
get something that makes perfect sense

629
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,880
instantly which is evolution selects for

630
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,880
organ isms cooperating with their

631
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,240
relatives something along those lines

632
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,080
and thus we have the second building

633
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,000
block known as kin selection Inclusive

634
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,640
fitness kin selection first building

635
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,399
block individual selection passing on

636
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,240
copies of your own genes as a way to

637
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,399
maximize future success second version

638
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,720
helping out relatives helping out

639
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,039
relatives in terms of increasing their

640
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
reproductive success with this vicious

641
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,039
mathematical logic which is you know one

642
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,320
identical twin two half SI two full

643
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,640
siblings eight cousins and so on as a

644
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,200
function of degree of relatedness and

645
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,000
what this begins to explain is a whole

646
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,760
world in animal behavior of animals

647
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,720
being obsessed with kinship animals

648
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,640
being fully aware of who is related to

649
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,840
who and what sorts of ways animals being

650
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,440
utterly aware of you cooperate with

651
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,480
relatives but as a function of how

652
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
closely related they are animals put us

653
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,480
in social anthropology and kinship terms

654
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,279
and could you marry the daughter of your

655
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,799
uncle's third wife or whatever to shame

656
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,960
in terms of how much a lot of social

657
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,640
animals deal with relatedness. So,

658
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,159
Inclusive fitness kin selection here

659
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:18,880
would be evidence for it here's one

660
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,399
example very cool study done some years

661
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:24,360
back by a couple sa farth and Cheney

662
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,080
University of Pennsylvania looking at

663
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,200
vervet monkeys and these were vervet

664
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,240
monkeys out in Tanzania I believe and

665
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,440
what they did was a whole bunch of these

666
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,039
vervent monkeys were sitting around and

667
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,279
they the researchers had made really

668
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,760
high quality record recordings of

669
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,720
various vocalizations from the monkeys

670
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,840
over time so they had the sound of each

671
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,760
animal giving an alarm call giving a

672
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,360
friendly gesture call giving a whatever

673
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,440
and what they would then do is hide a

674
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,440
microphone inside some bushes and play

675
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
the sound of one of the infants from the

676
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,919
group giving an alarm call

677
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,840
so what does the mother of that infant

678
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,399
do she instantly gets agitated and looks

679
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,000
over at the bush that's her child all of

680
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
that how to know that everyone else in

681
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,880
that verid group understands kin

682
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,480
selection what does everybody else do

683
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,559
they all look at the

684
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,919
mother that's whoever's mother what is

685
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,679
she going to do next they understand the

686
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,960
relatedness and they understand what the

687
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,640
response will be all the other vervets

688
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,000
look at the mother at that point Point

689
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,840
whoa I'm sure glad that's not my kid

690
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,760
giving an alarm call from the bushes

691
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,480
they understand kinship another version

692
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,679
of that that came out in these studies

693
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,080
so you've got two females each of whom

694
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,120
has a kid a daughter or whatever and

695
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,279
female a and female B and one day female

696
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,120
A does something absolutely rotten to

697
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,200
female B and later that day the child of

698
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,880
female B is more likely than chance to

699
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,159
do something rotten to the child of

700
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,600
female A.

701
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,320
they keeping track of not only Revenge

702
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,120
but not revenge on the individual who

703
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,159
did something miserable to you but

704
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,600
displaced by one degree of reproduction

705
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,519
keeping track of kinship. Animals can do

706
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,799
this all sorts of primate species can do

707
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,440
this and as we'll see all sorts of other

708
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,760
species can do this also there's that

709
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,600
caveat again all sorts of other species

710
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,480
want to figure out who their cousins

711
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,399
they don't want to figure out... Evolution

712
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,440
has sculpted an ability to optimize

713
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,200
behavior along lines of relatedness in

714
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,760
all sorts of species. So how would

715
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,399
natural selection play out in this realm

716
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,200
of kin selection I will lay down my life

717
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,279
for eight cousins. And that's just sort

718
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,880
of obvious there by now how would sexual

719
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,399
selection play out in this realm? I am

720
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,320
willing to expend great amounts of

721
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,679
energy to convince people that my

722
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,720
sibling is incredibly hot. And with any

723
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,640
chance, then passing on more copies of

724
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,240
genes that would be inclusive fitness

725
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,120
kin selection in both cases decreasing

726
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,640
your own reproductive potential by way

727
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
of being killed by a predator to save

728
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,279
the eight cousins or having to spend so

729
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,760
much time haranguing about your sibling.

730
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,399
Doing that in order to increase the

731
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:18,440
reproductive success of relatives where

732
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,679
you were willing to give up more energy

733
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:22,880
and potential on your part the more

734
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,279
closely related the individual is. So you

735
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,360
throw those two pieces together and

736
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,000
you're suddenly off and running with

737
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,679
explaining a lot of animal behavior.

738
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:34,840
Individual selection none of this for

739
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,799
the good of the species maximizing the

740
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,760
number of copies of your own genes and

741
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,799
the easiest way, the most straightforward

742
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,600
is you yourself maximizing

743
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,159
reproduction. Foundation number two to

744
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,880
the whole thing kin selection. Sometimes

745
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,440
the best way of leaving more copies and

746
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,840
genes in the next generation is using up

747
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,720
your own reproductive potential for

748
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,440
going to help relatives as a function of

749
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,720
degree of

750
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,960
relatedness. Okay that's great so now the

751
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,120
third piece the third final building

752
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,559
block of making sense of social behavior

753
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,440
in the context of real contemporary

754
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,679
evolutionary theory the third block here

755
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,000
which is you look at animals and they're

756
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,919
not all just competing with

757
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,120
non-relatives and things animals like

758
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,960
forgo competition at certain points

759
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,159
animals would have the potential to be

760
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:28,880
aggressive to other other animals and

761
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,880
they will forgo doing so and there's one

762
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,840
circumstance in which that can happen

763
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,639
where you get what is called a rock

764
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:38,039
paper scissor scenario you've got

765
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,799
animals A, B, and C a has a means of

766
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,279
damaging B but it costs a B has a means

767
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,240
of damaging C but it costs b c can

768
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,559
damage a but it costs a and you get the

769
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,679
right distribution of individuals with

770
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,519
one of those traits in a population and

771
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,720
you will reach a rock scissors paper

772
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
equilibrium where nobody is doing

773
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,120
anything rotten to each other great

774
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,320
example totally cool example that got

775
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,200
published some Years Ago by a guy named

776
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,320
Brendan Bohanan who was assistant

777
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,919
professor in the department here at the

778
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,080
time he was studying something or other

779
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,880
about bacteria showing a rock paper

780
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,320
scissor circumstance you had three

781
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,639
different types three different versions

782
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:20,639
of this bacteria in this Colony he had

783
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:25,480
made the first one could generate a

784
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,720
poison but it cost it had to put the

785
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,600
effort into making that poison and

786
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,480
protecting itself from that poison all

787
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,279
of that the second type was vulnerable

788
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,600
to the poison it happened to have some

789
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,440
transporter on its membrane that took up

790
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,799
the poison and that was bad news but it

791
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,880
had an advantage which is the rest of

792
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,880
the time that transporter took up more

793
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,120
food the third one the third one the

794
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,880
good thing going for it is that it

795
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,120
didn't have the bad thing was it didn't

796
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,320
have poison the good good thing going

797
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,000
for it was it didn't have to spend

798
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,200
energy on a poison and it didn't have

799
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,960
that transporter so each one of those

800
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,799
has a strength each one of those has a

801
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,679
vulnerability they're like I know

802
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,880
Pokemons or something and you put them

803
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,399
all together there and you get a rock

804
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,240
paper scissors scenario where you get

805
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,679
equilibrium where they are not attacking

806
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,240
each other because note if I am a and I

807
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,440
destroy b b's no longer wiping out C

808
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,320
who's the one who could damage me it's

809
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
got to come to an equilibrium state so

810
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,240
you can get the evolution of stalemates

811
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,840
like that and that's quite frequently

812
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,120
seen and note here this was the

813
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,559
evolution of stalemates not in chimps

814
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,600
not in sitations but in bacteria what

815
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,639
we're going to see is

816
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:48,039
bacterial Behavior to the extent that

817
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:50,120
this is sort of a metaphor for Behavior

818
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,200
behavior of all sorts of unlikely

819
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,240
species are subject to these same rules

820
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,120
of passing on copies of your genes these

821
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,760
three different strains of bacteria are

822
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,840
competing with each other none of them

823
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,880
are behaving for the good of the species

824
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,280
there of the three of them so rock paper

825
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
scissors is very cool and you get

826
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,480
versions of that in humans and that's

827
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,440
been sort of studied quantitatively all

828
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,960
of that but that's not real cooperation

829
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,239
that's merely everybody realizing we

830
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,639
have to cut back on the competition we

831
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,560
have to cut back on the aggression

832
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,119
because every time I damage whoever I am

833
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,119
more vulnerable in another Realm that's

834
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,359
a stalemate that's a truce but you look

835
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,560
at animals and in all sorts of realms

836
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,199
it's not just rock paper scissors

837
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,879
stalemates they're reaching they

838
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,199
actually cooperate with each other. And

839
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,239
you look close enough and you see

840
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,719
they're not relatives. They're not

841
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,119
relatives, yet you get all sorts of

842
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,679
altruistic behavior and you've got it

843
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,359
under a whole bunch of domains because

844
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,480
this brings up the question... why should

845
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,679
you ever be cooperative with another

846
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
individual if you're a social animal? At

847
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,720
every possibility, you should stab them

848
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
in the back and be selfish. And the

849
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,480
reason why that isn't a good idea is

850
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
there's all sorts of circumstances where

851
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,599
many hands make the task light or

852
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,480
whatever that is. Cooperation can have

853
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,160
synergistic benefits. And you see that

854
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,000
with species that are cooperative

855
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,320
hunters where they are not necessarily

856
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,960
relatives they will chase one chasing an

857
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,520
animal while the other is getting ready

858
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,839
to cut a corner on it Cooperative

859
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,800
behavior and they incre the likelihood

860
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,440
of them getting a kill another example

861
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
of this researched by a guy named Mark

862
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,680
Hower at Harvard looking at Reese's

863
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,880
monkeys and what he showed was he would

864
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,359
put these monkeys in a situation where

865
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:43,160
they had access to food they had access

866
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,880
to food under one circumstance where

867
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,240
they could reach for it and take it in

868
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,359
and share it with another monkey under

869
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,280
the other circumstance it required two

870
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,839
monkeys to get the food in there and

871
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,079
what he showed was clear-cut reciprocity

872
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,720
monkeys who were sharing with this guy

873
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,680
were more likely to get shared back with

874
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,079
and got more cooperation when it was a

875
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,880
task where two of them had to work

876
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,000
together to get the food one alone

877
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,280
wasn't enough many hands make the task

878
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,319
lighter under all sorts of circumstances

879
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:20,079
cooperation has a strong evolutionary

880
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,599
payoff even among

881
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,400
non-relatives with a condition which is

882
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,200
you're not putting more into with then

883
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,720
you are getting that is reciprocal and

884
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,960
this opens up the third building block

885
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,760
of all of this which is reciprocal

886
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,200
altruism cooperation altruistic Behavior

887
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,119
among non-relatives but undergoing very

888
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,480
strict sort of constraints of it's got

889
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,760
to be reciprocated with all sorts of

890
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,119
rules like that so what does that look

891
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:54,839
like so you're going to see reciprocal

892
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,040
altruism when would you see that what's

893
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,160
the immediate thing what sort of species

894
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,640
would show systems of reciprocal

895
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,160
cooperation among non-relatives they got

896
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,040
to be smart animals they got to be

897
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
social they got to be smart why do they

898
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,520
have to be smart because they have to

899
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,960
remember this is the guy who like owes

900
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,119
me a favor from last Thursday they need

901
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,880
to be able to recognize individuals they

902
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,040
have to be long lived enough so that

903
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
there's a chance of interacting with

904
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,160
that individual again and establishing

905
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,000
this reciprocity you would thus predict

906
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,960
you would see systems of reciprocal

907
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,680
altruism only in longlived Social

908
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,200
vertebrates but you see the exact sorts

909
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,599
of things in bacteria you see the exact

910
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:41,240
sort of things in fungi you see that in

911
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,680
all sorts of other Realms you get social

912
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,119
bacteria colonizing bacteria and where

913
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,960
what you might get are two clonal lines

914
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,599
that are together in other words two

915
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:55,680
genetically two lines Each of which is

916
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,520
all the bacteria have the same genetic

917
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,319
makeup so think of it as one individual

918
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,440
who's just kind of dispersed another one

919
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,680
who's just kind of dispersed and they've

920
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,760
come together in something called a

921
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,680
fruiting body which is how bacteria

922
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,520
reproduce or whatever and there's two

923
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,400
parts to a fruiting body there's one

924
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,440
which is the stock which attaches to

925
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,760
something or other and then there's the

926
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,520
part that actually fruits so you want to

927
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,119
be in the fruiting part because that's

928
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,720
the part that actually reproduces and

929
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,480
the stock is doing all the work there

930
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,440
and what you see is attempts at cheating

931
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,440
attempts at one of these strains trying

932
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,280
to disproportionately wind up in the

933
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,319
Fring part and what you also see is the

934
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,880
next time around this other strain will

935
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,720
not cooperate with it will not form a

936
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,119
social Colony so that's getting played

937
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,920
off at the level of single cell

938
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,480
organisms forming big social colonies

939
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,640
getting played at that level yes as we

940
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,839
will see reciprocal altruism works most

941
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:59,200
readily in big smart Long Live social

942
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,599
beasts but it can occur in all sorts of

943
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,560
systems so what it's built around is

944
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,800
reciprocal cooperation and intrinsic in

945
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,079
that is another motivation going on

946
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,040
there not just to involve a reciprocal

947
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,880
relationship with a non-relative and

948
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,800
many hands and light tasks and all of

949
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,599
that but also whenever possible to cheat

950
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,640
to take advantage of the other

951
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,560
individual and thus another key facet of

952
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,240
it is to very good at detecting when

953
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,079
somebody is cheating against you to be

954
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,920
vigilant about cheating in what would

955
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,000
otherwise be a stable reciprocal

956
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,240
relationship and an awful lot of social

957
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,319
behavior is built around animals either

958
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:46,560
trying to get away with something or

959
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,920
spotting somebody else doing the same an

960
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,839
example of it there is a test that's

961
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,079
used in evolutionary psychology where

962
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:55,760
you're given this very complicated story

963
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,599
or another version of a complicated

964
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,960
story where somebody promises if you do

965
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,880
this you'll get this reward but if you

966
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,960
do that you're going to get this

967
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,400
punishment and like really complex and

968
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,480
in one outcome the outcome of it is the

969
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,680
person isn't supposed to get rewarded

970
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,839
but the individual decides to reward

971
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,839
them spontaneous act of kindness in

972
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,800
another Circumstance the person is the

973
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
individual is supposed to get rewarded

974
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,720
and instead they get punished a cheater

975
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,200
in that case and amid these convoluted

976
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,760
stories people are much better 75% to 25

977
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,800
are much better at detecting when

978
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,319
cheating has gone on in the story than

979
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,599
when a random active kindness has gone

980
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,119
on we are more attuned to picking up

981
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,480
cheating and remarkably some very subtle

982
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,240
Studies have been done with chimps

983
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,760
showing that chimps have the same bias

984
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,560
they are much better at picking up

985
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,359
social interactions involving cheating

986
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,440
than ones that involve spontaneous

987
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,720
altruism so you see here this balance

988
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,079
between cooperation and reciprocal and

989
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,000
even among non-relatives and that's

990
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,440
great but you should cheat when you can

991
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,720
get away with it but you should be

992
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,760
vigilant against cheaters and what of

993
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,480
course it comes down to then is tic TCT

994
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,359
toe and giraffe hearts and all of that

995
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:14,800
what is the optimal strategy in a

996
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
particular social species for a

997
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,560
particular individual what is the

998
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,119
optimal strategy when do you cooperate

999
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:25,440
and when do you cheat when do you defect

1000
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,640
on the Cooperative relationship you've

1001
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,560
had and this introduces us to a whole

1002
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,200
world of mathematics built around what

1003
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,560
is called Game Theory the notion that

1004
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,160
there are games formal games that have

1005
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,560
mathematically optimal strategies or

1006
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,200
multiple strategies multi equilibrium

1007
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,240
and a whole world of research has been

1008
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,440
built around them in terms of when to

1009
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,920
cooperate and when to defect so Game

1010
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,040
Theory stuff this was starting off in a

1011
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,640
world of like people studying economics

1012
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,400
and negotiation and diplomacy and all of

1013
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,280
that and that was a whole world built

1014
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,200
around this logic of when do you

1015
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,359
cooperate when do you cheat and what

1016
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,560
came out of there were all sorts of

1017
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,400
models of how to optimize behavior in

1018
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,560
terms of that and the building block

1019
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,280
sort of the fruit fly of game theory is

1020
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,040
a game called the prisoners

1021
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,200
dilemma prisoners dilemma sort of

1022
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,160
cutting to Z details two individuals are

1023
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,119
prisoners and they escape and they're

1024
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,200
both captured and they're interrogated

1025
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,400
separately and if both of them refuse to

1026
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,760
talk that's great for them if they both

1027
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,960
squeal they both get punished if one of

1028
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,680
them is able to squeal on the other one

1029
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,520
they get a great reward of the other one

1030
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,680
what you get formally are four possible

1031
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,319
outcomes both individuals

1032
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,319
cooperate both individuals cheat against

1033
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:57,240
each other

1034
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,240
individual a cooperates and B

1035
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,079
cheats individual B cooperates and a

1036
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:04,839
cheats and what you get in prisoners

1037
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,760
dilemma is a formal payoff for each what

1038
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,599
gives you the greatest payoff stabbing

1039
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,400
the other guy in the back you cheat and

1040
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,920
they cooperate you have exploited them

1041
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,839
you have taken advantage of them isn't

1042
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,400
that wonderful that's the highest payoff

1043
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,839
in prison or dilemma games second

1044
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:25,800
highest payoff you both

1045
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,440
cooperate third third highest payoff

1046
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,839
which is beginning to not count as a

1047
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,520
payoff but in a lot of the games is set

1048
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,800
up as the start of punishment both of

1049
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,720
you cheat on each

1050
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,559
other fourth worst possible payoff is

1051
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:41,960
you're the sucker you cooperate and the

1052
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,480
other individual stabs you in the back

1053
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,720
so what the prisoners dilemma game is

1054
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,040
set up these circumstances where

1055
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,559
individuals will play versions of this

1056
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:54,319
against each other with varying rewards

1057
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,280
and that sort of thing and parameters

1058
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,400
that we will look at in a lot of detail

1059
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,680
and seeing when is it optimal to

1060
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,000
cooperate when is it optimal to cheat

1061
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,520
when would you do this so you've got

1062
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,240
examples of this and this was the

1063
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,680
building block and what anyone would say

1064
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,680
looking at this is it's obvious what you

1065
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,800
want to do is in some way rationally

1066
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,800
maximize your payoff this is this whole

1067
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,079
world of homo economists the notion of

1068
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,559
humans as being purely rational decision

1069
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:27,760
makers and what you begin to see in this

1070
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,960
world of game theory is there is

1071
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,480
anything but that going on and later in

1072
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,040
the course we are going to see something

1073
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,960
very interesting people playing

1074
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,280
prisoners dilemma games inside a brain

1075
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,599
scanner looking at a part of the brain

1076
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,280
that has a lot to do with pleasure and

1077
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,800
what you see is some individuals

1078
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,680
activate that part of the brain when

1079
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,400
they've successfully stabbed the other

1080
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,599
guy in the back some individuals

1081
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,200
activate it when they have both

1082
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,000
cooperated and there's a big gender

1083
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,440
difference as to which which

1084
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,040
circumstance so you just guess which one

1085
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,839
is going on there we're going to see a

1086
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,599
number of studies like that coming down

1087
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,599
the line so the question becomes how do

1088
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:10,480
you optimize prisoner dilic play and

1089
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,400
what emerged at that time was the notion

1090
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,680
of all sorts of theoretical models and

1091
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,359
stuff and then in the 1970s there was an

1092
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,280
economist at University of Michigan

1093
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,280
named Robert Axelrod who revolutionized

1094
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,280
the entire field what he did was he took

1095
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,880
some Paleolithic comp computer and

1096
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,800
programmed in how the prisoners dilemma

1097
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,040
would be played and he could program in

1098
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,240
as if they were two players and he could

1099
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,400
program in what each one's strategy

1100
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,280
would

1101
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,680
be and what he then did was he wrote to

1102
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,480
all of his buddies and all of his

1103
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,440
mathematician friends and prize Fighters

1104
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,640
and theologians and serial murderers and

1105
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,839
Nobel Peace Prize winners and in each

1106
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,200
case explain what was up and saying what

1107
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,640
strategy would you use in a prisoner's

1108
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,240
dilemma a game and he gets them all back

1109
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,720
and he programs all these different

1110
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,240
versions and he runs a round robin

1111
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,839
tournament every strategy is paired

1112
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,559
against every other strategy at one

1113
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:09,440
point or other and you look at what the

1114
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,359
payoff is you ask which is the most

1115
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:15,839
optimal strategy and out of it

1116
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,040
shockingly to everyone because this was

1117
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,880
a computer teaching us optimizing human

1118
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,640
behavior out of it came one simple

1119
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,640
strategy that always outcompeted the

1120
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,480
others this is people sitting there

1121
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,280
probabilistic ones as to when to

1122
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,359
cooperate and lunar cycles as to what to

1123
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,680
do the one that always one is now called

1124
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,920
tit

1125
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,119
fortat you start off cooperating in the

1126
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,640
very first round with the individual you

1127
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,880
cooperate if the individual has

1128
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,280
cooperated with you in that round you

1129
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,040
cooperate in the next round and you

1130
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,760
cooperate cooperate as long as the other

1131
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,800
individual cooperates but as soon as

1132
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,480
there's a round where the individual

1133
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,599
cheats against you you cheat against

1134
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:03,119
them the next time if they cheated at

1135
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,240
you that time also you cheat against

1136
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,319
them the next time if they go back to

1137
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:09,880
cooperating you go back to cooperating

1138
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,680
the next time you have this tit fortat

1139
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,800
strategy in the absence of somebody

1140
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,000
stabbing you in the back you will always

1141
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,559
cooperate and what they found was run

1142
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:22,200
these hundreds of thousands of versions

1143
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,559
of these round robin tournaments and tit

1144
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,280
fortat was the one that was most optimal

1145
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,839
to begin to use a word that is not just

1146
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,720
going to be a metaphor tit fortat always

1147
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,839
drove the other strategies into

1148
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,319
Extinction and what you wound up seeing

1149
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,160
is this optimized strategy and it was

1150
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,200
very clear why tit fortat worked so well

1151
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,240
number one it was nice you start off

1152
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,440
cooperating number two it retaliates if

1153
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,160
you do something crummy to it number

1154
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,359
three it is forgiving if you go back to

1155
00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:57,480
cooperate

1156
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,119
number four it's clearcut in its play

1157
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,599
it's not some probabilistic thing and

1158
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:05,440
what you get then with tit fortat is

1159
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,200
suppose you're playing three rounds with

1160
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,119
another individual you both cooperate

1161
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,839
the first one you both cooperate the

1162
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:12,559
next one you're playing tit fortat

1163
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,240
strategy so you cooperate on this one

1164
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,119
and they stab you in the back and you

1165
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:17,680
can't get back at them because this is

1166
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,000
the last round what you'll see is under

1167
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,559
lots of circumstances Tit for Tat is

1168
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:25,640
disadvantageous but what the sound bite

1169
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,319
is about it is Tit for Tat may lose the

1170
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,160
battles but it wins all the wars this

1171
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,400
pattern of being nice but being

1172
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,760
retaliatory being forgiving and being

1173
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,599
clear in the rules drives all the other

1174
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,079
strategies into

1175
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:43,599
Extinction okay at this point my alarm

1176
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,599
just went off which was to remind me to

1177
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,000
ask somebody who is wearing a life vest

1178
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,200
is somebody wearing a life

1179
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,880
vest over there um where are you

1180
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,319
she just left she left isn't that

1181
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:01,079
interesting somebody put me up to having

1182
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,240
to ask this person why are you wearing a

1183
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,119
life vest and apparently the answer she

1184
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,280
would give was going to free all sorts

1185
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,839
of captives in some like Rebel group in

1186
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,079
Colombia and she fled okay what that

1187
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,960
does is

1188
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,079
uh I don't know what that says about

1189
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,640
reciprocal altruism but what that says

1190
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,040
also is after I do a summary don't make

1191
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,079
a move we will have a 5 minute break so

1192
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,960
what do we have at this point we have a

1193
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,319
first building block of optimizing the

1194
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:31,280
evolution of behavior like optimizing

1195
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,839
giraffe Hearts first piece you don't

1196
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,079
believe behave for the good of the

1197
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:37,319
species individual selection passing on

1198
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,160
as many copies of your own genes as

1199
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,720
possible sometime a chicken is an egg's

1200
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,480
way of making another egg he says

1201
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,280
triumphantly building block number two

1202
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,240
kin selection some of the time the best

1203
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,799
way to pass on copies of your jeans is

1204
00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:53,079
by way of helping relatives kin

1205
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:54,920
selection with the mathematical

1206
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,280
fierceness of degree of relat is driving

1207
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,319
it piece three sometimes what's most

1208
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,640
advantageous is to cooperate even with

1209
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,079
non-relatives but with the rules of it

1210
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:07,480
has to be reciprocal and you have to

1211
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,119
cheat when possible you have to be on

1212
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,079
guard against cheaters and as we've just

1213
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:13,720
seen Game Theory prisoners dilemma

1214
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,480
beginning to formalize Optimal

1215
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,280
strategies for that okay let's take a

1216
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,359
five minute

1217
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,319
break but promise you will come back if

1218
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:27,599
you go out and everyone won't wander off

1219
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:30,440
of

1220
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,640
being maximize that behavior in a very

1221
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,880
artificial realm but stay tuned

1222
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,240
prisoners dilemma as the building block

1223
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
of how to do this amid lots of other

1224
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,880
types of games that are used but

1225
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,160
prisoners dilemma is the most basic one

1226
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,240
and that round robin tournament that

1227
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,240
computer simulation Axel Rod asking all

1228
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,680
his buddies to tell him what strategy

1229
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,240
would you use run them against each

1230
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,920
other and out comes tit fortat Tit for

1231
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,440
Tat Drive all the others into

1232
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,440
Extinction however there is a

1233
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,040
vulnerability in tit for which

1234
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,720
is okay so we have the technical way of

1235
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,680
showing prisoners dilemma play and first

1236
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,440
round both individuals are cooperating

1237
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,119
second round both individuals are

1238
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,000
cooperating third round this one cheats

1239
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,599
those are fangs this one cheats and this

1240
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:37,720
one cooperates so the next round this

1241
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,799
one now cheats and this one goes back to

1242
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:42,960
cooperating and we've just gotten

1243
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,599
through a scary thing that Tit for Tat

1244
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,359
solves and it's great wonderful what if

1245
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,720
though your system is not 100% perfect

1246
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,520
what if there's the possibility of a

1247
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,640
mistake being made of sending the wrong

1248
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,079
signal what if there's the possibility

1249
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,240
of noise in the communication system and

1250
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,680
at some point an individual who does a

1251
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,160
Cooperative Behavior thanks to a glitch

1252
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,000
in the system it is read as having been

1253
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,440
defect

1254
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,000
defection so what happens as a

1255
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,200
result this

1256
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,280
individual forget it okay what happens

1257
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,040
as a result the individual who

1258
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,760
cooperated but somehow the message got

1259
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,000
through is cheating they don't know

1260
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,760
something got lost in the wires between

1261
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,079
them in Translation the other individual

1262
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,839
was saying whoa that individual cheated

1263
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:38,559
against me I'm going to cheat in the

1264
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,000
next round so Along Comes the next round

1265
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,200
and that individual cheats against them

1266
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,720
this one who's cooperating because

1267
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,280
they've been cooperating all along they

1268
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,559
don't know about this error and they say

1269
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,920
whoa that person just cheated against me

1270
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,920
I'm going to cheat in the next round so

1271
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,280
they cheat in the next round this one

1272
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,960
says Whoa they just cheated another time

1273
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,920
again and again and again and what you

1274
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,920
get is a seesaw pattern for the rest of

1275
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,839
time you've just wiped out 50% of the

1276
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:07,520
cooperation and what you've got is tit

1277
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,440
fortat strategies are vulnerable to

1278
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,920
Signal error that's something that soon

1279
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,359
came out in these studies of axle rods

1280
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,319
and when I was a kid there was like one

1281
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,680
of these like thriller books I remember

1282
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,440
reading where there's a glitch in the

1283
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,720
system and at the time the mean scary

1284
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,359
Soviet Union launched a missile that no

1285
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:30,079
it was the United States the United

1286
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,640
States by accident launched a missile a

1287
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,880
nuclear weapon where they didn't mean to

1288
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,599
some cockroach you know chewed through a

1289
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,599
wire someplace or other and the missile

1290
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,760
went off and wound up being destroying

1291
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,920
Moscow and oh my God we had a

1292
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,720
Cooperative system of mutually sort of

1293
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,760
Restraint of aggression all of that and

1294
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,280
thanks to a signal error a cheating

1295
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,680
signal was accidentally sent off and how

1296
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,400
did the book end a tit for response in

1297
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,960
order to avoid sort of thermonuclear

1298
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,680
Wasteland the Soviet Union was allowed

1299
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,160
to destroy New York all right so that

1300
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,720
shows exactly how you could then get

1301
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,160
into a seawing thing simply by way of if

1302
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,480
the system has any vulnerability to

1303
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,240
Signal error so it soon became clear as

1304
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,599
soon as Axel Rod began to introduce the

1305
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,839
possibility of signal errors that tiit

1306
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,520
fortat didn't work as well as another

1307
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,920
strategy one that quickly came to the

1308
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,359
Forefront and that

1309
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,960
one for some strange reason that's the

1310
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,040
way it's shown that one was called

1311
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,480
forgiving tit

1312
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,799
fortat what happens with forgiving tit

1313
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:44,400
fortat the usual rule like Tit for Tat

1314
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,079
if you cooperate if they cooperate you

1315
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,760
always cooperate if they cheat against

1316
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,119
you you punish them in the next round

1317
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:52,559
exactly same thing as Tit for Tat but oh

1318
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,839
no what if there's a signal error in the

1319
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:57,319
system and you've gotten in one of these

1320
00:54:57,319 --> 00:55:00,240
horrible seawing things what forgiving

1321
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,160
TI fortat does is we'll have a rule for

1322
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,520
example that if we seesaw like this five

1323
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,599
times in a row I will foro cheating the

1324
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,200
next time and instead I'll cooperate and

1325
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,960
that will get things back on track I am

1326
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,880
willing to be forgiving in one round in

1327
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,920
order to reestablish cooperation after

1328
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,079
the signal error came in and that one as

1329
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:26,319
soon as you introduce the Poss

1330
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,559
possibility of signal error that one out

1331
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,640
competes tit fortat because it makes

1332
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,839
perfect sense it's a great way of

1333
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,280
solving that

1334
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,960
problem so that was terrific tit fortat

1335
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,640
but the ability to forgive and what you

1336
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,520
would then see is variability how many

1337
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,440
of these do you need to go through

1338
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,400
before you forgive what's the optimal

1339
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,599
number of sees songs all of that so a

1340
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,079
whole world of optimizing how soon you

1341
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,480
were forgiving nonetheless the general

1342
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,960
theme being forgiving TI for Tat out

1343
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,400
canach TI for Tat when you can have

1344
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,160
signal error but there is a

1345
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,440
vulnerability there is a vulnerability

1346
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,280
here to this one which is you could be

1347
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,680
exploited if you're playing against for

1348
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,960
example a tit for tar or all sorts of

1349
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,799
other strategies where they don't have

1350
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:17,119
forgiving strings of defection and you

1351
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,000
do what's going to happen is you're

1352
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,640
going to keep going back to cooperating

1353
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,760
and they're going to keep stabbing you

1354
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,119
in your back forgiving Tit for Tat is

1355
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,039
vulnerable to exploitation playing

1356
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:30,400
against individual players that don't

1357
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,559
have forgiveness in them so what soon

1358
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:36,920
became apparent was an even better

1359
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,160
strategy which

1360
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:47,960
is you start off with a tit fortat

1361
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,280
strategy which is you are punitive you

1362
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,319
are retaliatory amid being forgiving

1363
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,720
clear nice initially you were willing to

1364
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,839
punish and you cannot be exploited in

1365
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:02,640
this way if and only if you have gone

1366
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,680
whatever number of rounds without the

1367
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,200
other individual ever cheating on you if

1368
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,839
you've gone long enough without that

1369
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:11,200
happening you switch over to forgiving

1370
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,839
tit fortat what is that that's deciding

1371
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:16,680
you trust somebody you've had enough

1372
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,559
interactions with them that you are

1373
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,640
willing to trust them this is the

1374
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,920
transition from Pure rational optimizing

1375
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,119
to switching over forgiveness coming in

1376
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,400
there protects you from signal error and

1377
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,440
of course now a whole world of how many

1378
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,359
rounds do you need to do this before you

1379
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,480
switch that as to what the optimal deal

1380
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,319
with that is but again this is a way of

1381
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,160
transitioning to solve the problem of

1382
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,039
signal error but forgiving too readily

1383
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:49,359
and being taken advantage of soon

1384
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,480
another strategy appeared which was

1385
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,480
called

1386
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,640
Pavlov and those of you who know

1387
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,760
pavlovian psychology will see that this

1388
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,319
in fact has nothing whatsoever to do

1389
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:01,200
with pavlovian psychology and I don't

1390
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,960
know why they did that but they thought

1391
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,839
it was kind of cool but the rule was

1392
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,760
remember if you stab the other guy in

1393
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,839
the back you get a bunch of points if

1394
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:13,160
you both cooperate you get points not as

1395
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,319
many if you both cheat you lose some

1396
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,760
points if you're taken advantage of you

1397
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,480
lose a lot of points so two outcomes you

1398
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,240
gain two outcomes you lose in Pavo the

1399
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,359
simple rule is when I I do something if

1400
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,720
I get points if I get some degree of

1401
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,280
reward I do it again the next time if I

1402
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,240
get rewarded and either of the first two

1403
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,400
types of payoffs I do the same thing

1404
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,280
again and the other part of course is

1405
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,440
and if I have if I play my strategy and

1406
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,760
I lose one of the two bottom the two

1407
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,079
bottom outcomes I switch to the other

1408
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:52,319
strategy the next time and what you see

1409
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,160
is that can establish very good Tit for

1410
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,760
Tat stuff but if you sit and spend hours

1411
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,799
tonight with you know a long roll of

1412
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:01,319
toilet paper and playing out all the

1413
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:03,640
rounds of it you will see what pav love

1414
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,640
allows you to do is exploit somebody

1415
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,480
else who is forgiving so Pavlov goes

1416
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,520
along just fine with this and as long as

1417
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,200
Pavlov continues whenever they switch

1418
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,960
over to a forgiving tit fortat Pavlov

1419
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,359
will outcompete them because Pavlov

1420
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,680
exploits what then emerged was just

1421
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,000
zillions of people stud all sorts of

1422
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,119
games like this and there's other ones

1423
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,119
ultimatum game is a trust game where

1424
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:34,599
it's the same notion of business there

1425
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:36,599
which is you choose to cooperate you

1426
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:38,440
choose to cheat what's the optimal

1427
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,039
outcome there are mathematically optimal

1428
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:43,160
outcomes that you can use and you run

1429
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,319
all of it against the computer and you

1430
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:47,119
get the optimization popping out the

1431
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,319
other end wonderful so there's Axel rod

1432
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,920
and there's buddies using terms like oh

1433
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,960
this strategy will drive the other one

1434
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,760
into Extinction or this strategy works

1435
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,839
but if you program in that every now and

1436
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:02,720
then there could be a glitch there can

1437
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,280
be a mutation this will be they're using

1438
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,160
all this biology jargon obviously

1439
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,119
metaphorically but right around this

1440
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:12,640
point the biologists look at this who

1441
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,359
are just beginning to think about the

1442
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,920
social biology stuff formal patterns of

1443
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,559
optimizing behavior and they say whoa

1444
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:24,000
does this apply to the behavior of real

1445
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,240
organisms because at this point it's

1446
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,000
just economists and computer types and

1447
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,720
diplomats learning when to optimize all

1448
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,079
that sort of thing around the time there

1449
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,880
was a paper published somewhat before

1450
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,160
that this is a name nobody is going to

1451
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,640
know lost in history a guy named Daniel

1452
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,920
Ellsberg Daniel Ellsberg became very

1453
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,760
famous around 1970 by he was working in

1454
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,680
the Pentagon and he stole thousands of

1455
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,079
pages of secret files there and gave it

1456
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:56,319
to the New York Times showing how utter

1457
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,240
corrupt everything that went on behind

1458
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,920
the scenes was and getting us into

1459
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,039
Vietnam major blow out all of that he

1460
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:05,319
had spent the early part of his career

1461
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:07,000
perfectly happily working in the

1462
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,920
Pentagon for the military as a game

1463
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,440
theorist as a game theorist coming up

1464
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,960
with optimal patterns and he wrote one

1465
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,200
paper called the optimal benefits of

1466
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,440
perceived

1467
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,280
Madness what what times do you want your

1468
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,680
opponent to think you were absolutely

1469
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,440
out of your mind and good to do all

1470
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,680
sorts of crazy stuff and where they wind

1471
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,760
up cooperating to keep you from doing

1472
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,720
that the advantages of Madness what's

1473
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,400
that that systems where things like

1474
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,640
mutually assured destruction doesn't

1475
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,960
work because you're willing to set it

1476
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,559
off that the advantages of Madness this

1477
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,880
whole world of people working on it

1478
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,880
mathematicians and more strategists and

1479
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,079
there's the zoologists now looking at

1480
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,880
this saying whoa this is cool I wonder

1481
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,680
if animals behave that way and that's

1482
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,680
when people now armed with their

1483
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,000
insights into prisoners dilemma and tit

1484
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,400
fortat and all this stuff started to go

1485
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,440
and study animals out in the wild and

1486
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,720
see were there any examples where this

1487
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,160
happened yes in all sorts of interesting

1488
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,119
Realms first example vampire bats

1489
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:18,319
vampire bats we are all set up to be

1490
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,520
creeped out by vampire bats but in

1491
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,720
actuality when you see a vampire bat

1492
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,760
drinking the blood of some cow or

1493
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,720
something you are watching at a mommy

1494
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,359
getting food for her babies because

1495
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:32,359
vampire bat mothers are not actually

1496
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:34,559
drinking the blood they're filling up

1497
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,559
this throat sack thing and they go back

1498
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,119
to the nest and they discourage the

1499
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:40,640
blood to feed their babies she's just

1500
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,599
watching out for her kids it happens

1501
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,559
that vampire bats have an interesting

1502
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:48,039
system of reciprocal altruism which is a

1503
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:50,119
whole bunch of females will share the

1504
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:52,520
same nest we'll have all their kids in

1505
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,279
there mixed in and these are not

1506
01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:56,359
necessarily related so so we've just

1507
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:58,400
left the world of kin selection they're

1508
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,319
not necessarily related but they have

1509
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,839
reciprocal altruist system each female

1510
01:03:02,839 --> 01:03:06,000
comes in Discord disgorges the blood and

1511
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,240
feeds everybody's babies and they'll all

1512
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,920
feed each other's babies and everything

1513
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,799
is terrific and they have this blood

1514
01:03:11,799 --> 01:03:14,440
vampire commune going there and they

1515
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,039
have reached a nice state of stable

1516
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,279
cooperation now make the bats think that

1517
01:03:20,279 --> 01:03:23,559
one of the females is cheating on them

1518
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:25,559
out comes that female flying off to find

1519
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:28,520
some blood and instead you net her and

1520
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,839
get a hold of her and take some syringe

1521
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:33,160
full of air and pump up the throat sack

1522
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,520
so the throat sack is really full and

1523
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,240
distended but there's no blood in there

1524
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,440
you just pumped air into there and stick

1525
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,880
her back into the nest there and she's

1526
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,520
just sitting there happily and the other

1527
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,960
females are sitting saying look at her

1528
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,920
look at how much blood she's got there I

1529
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,880
can't believe it cuz she's not feeding

1530
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,640
our kids she's cheating on us and the

1531
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,920
next time they go out to feed the other

1532
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,279
females don't feed her kids a Tit for

1533
01:03:57,279 --> 01:04:00,319
Tat and what you saw here is an exact

1534
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,799
example of introducing signal error

1535
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,720
signal error in this case being some

1536
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,760
grad student pumping up the throat of

1537
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,119
some vampire bat and showing that

1538
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,640
they're using a version of a Tit for Tat

1539
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,480
strategy totally amazing people were

1540
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,960
blown away by this another example fish

1541
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,599
stickleback fish who in the world of

1542
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:24,680
animals you know bats are probably not

1543
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,200
some of the brightest folks around but I

1544
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,160
don't think sticklebacks are within

1545
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,559
light years of them but stickleback fish

1546
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,000
can do a tid fortat strategy here's what

1547
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,279
you do you have a stickleback fish in

1548
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:39,680
your in your fish tank and you make the

1549
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,559
fish you make him believe that he's

1550
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:44,400
being attacked by another fish what do

1551
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,359
you do you put a mirror up against the

1552
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:48,720
edge of the tank there so within a very

1553
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,440
short time I told you they were not that

1554
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,720
smart so but in a very short time he's

1555
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,319
lunging forward at this mirrored thing

1556
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:57,520
and maintaining his territory against

1557
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,920
this guy and barely holding on and that

1558
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,520
other guy is just he doesn't get tired

1559
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,640
thank God I don't get tired and they're

1560
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,520
just going at it and now make him think

1561
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,880
he has a Cooperative partner put in a

1562
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,160
second mirror that's perpendicular here

1563
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,880
in other words he sees his reflection

1564
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,680
there and every time he moves forward he

1565
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,240
sees that one moving forward and which

1566
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,160
is fortunate because he's also seeing

1567
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,839
another fish coming from that way and

1568
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,160
he's sitting there saying this is great

1569
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,279
I don't know who this guy is but wow

1570
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:31,920
what a team we are doubles this is great

1571
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,359
he's in there in the thick it's funny

1572
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,079
how those two guys are so synchronized

1573
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:37,119
but whoa we're holding them off and

1574
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,000
we're doing now make him think his

1575
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,039
cooperating partner is in fact cheating

1576
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:45,160
on him take the mirror and angle it back

1577
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,039
a little bit so the reflection is set

1578
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:51,279
back some and what he now sees is the

1579
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:53,400
fish moving forward but not all the way

1580
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,480
up to the wall there the fish is hanging

1581
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,039
back back there the fish is cheating and

1582
01:05:58,039 --> 01:05:59,480
this stickle back is sitting there

1583
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,279
saying in effect that son of a I

1584
01:06:02,279 --> 01:06:03,640
can't believe he's doing that to me

1585
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,880
we've worked together for years I can't

1586
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,240
believe he's oh he's pretending to go

1587
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,279
forward but I see he's not really doing

1588
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,400
that fortunately that guy isn't coming

1589
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,920
forward anymore either pH but I can't

1590
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,520
believe that guy's cheating and the next

1591
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,079
time you set up this scenario the next

1592
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,319
time move the chance the stickle back

1593
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,880
doesn't attack its own reflection there

1594
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,279
it is tit for tatting against this guy

1595
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:28,440
so here we've managed to set up one of

1596
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,760
these deals within one fish and carrying

1597
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,039
it out forever one fish ultimately with

1598
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,760
some very blistered lips Tit for Tat

1599
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,640
once again another example this is the

1600
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,559
most bizarre one I can imagine and leads

1601
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:43,079
to all sorts of subjects that are going

1602
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,160
to come many lectures from now but there

1603
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,559
are fish species that will change sex

1604
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,359
and they do it under all sorts of

1605
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:53,000
strategic circumstances that suddenly

1606
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,760
begin to fit into this realm of what

1607
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,960
we've been learning about out and you've

1608
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,839
got one of these things called black

1609
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:02,359
Hamlet fish and they can change gender

1610
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:04,440
so you'll have a pair of them who hang

1611
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,680
out with each other of opposite genders

1612
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,480
and they take turns they flip back and

1613
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,640
forth for a while this one's female and

1614
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,000
for a while this one's female and they

1615
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,880
go back and forth and that's great but

1616
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,039
there's an inequity there which is that

1617
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:18,400
the price of reproduction is greater for

1618
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,720
the female than for the male as is the

1619
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,520
case in so many species the female is

1620
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,640
doing all that egg and over duct and

1621
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,680
progesterone stuff or whatever it is and

1622
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,240
the males just got to come up with some

1623
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,000
sperm there doing reproduction as a

1624
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,680
cooperating pair they're not relatives

1625
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,400
reciprocal altruism maximizing each of

1626
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,359
their reproductions whoever is the

1627
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:42,640
female in any given round is the one

1628
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,960
who's paying more and what you see are

1629
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,760
reciprocal relationships there of the

1630
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,880
fish using Tit for Tat if you get one

1631
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,279
fish that begins to cheat and winds up

1632
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,799
being a male too much the time the other

1633
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,440
fish stops cooperating with them again

1634
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,079
tit fortat stuff so people were just

1635
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,200
blown out of the water at this point

1636
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,599
seeing whoa forget rational human

1637
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,599
economic thinking and all of that you go

1638
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,960
out into the wild and bats and

1639
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,359
stickleback fish and gender switching

1640
01:08:14,359 --> 01:08:16,279
fish and all of that they're following

1641
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:18,759
some of the exact same strategies isn't

1642
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:21,679
nature amazing no nature isn't amazing

1643
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,080
it's the exact same logic as saying a

1644
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,679
giraffe has to have heart that's strong

1645
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:28,279
enough to pump blood to the top of the

1646
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:30,319
head of a giraffe or else there wouldn't

1647
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,560
be giraffe and when you look at this

1648
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,359
realm it's applying the same notion the

1649
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,238
same sort of wind tunnel of selective

1650
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:41,279
optimization for behavior in this case

1651
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,960
went to cheat went to cooperate sculpt

1652
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,600
something that is as optimized as a

1653
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,000
giraffe's heart being the right size so

1654
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,319
this made perfect sense wonderful but

1655
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,080
then people began to look a little bit

1656
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,000
closer and began to see sort of the very

1657
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,759
distressing real world beginning to

1658
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,839
creep in there which were exceptions

1659
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,120
first exception this was done by a guy

1660
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,679
named Craig Packer University of

1661
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,120
Minnesota looking at lions in East

1662
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,399
Africa and what you get is typically

1663
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:13,399
Prides are a whole bunch of relatives

1664
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,198
usually females sisters nieces all of

1665
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:17,880
that but you will sometimes get Prides

1666
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,479
that are not of close relatives

1667
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:21,719
nonetheless they will get you know

1668
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:24,399
reciprocal altruistic things going on

1669
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,880
lions in this case having the same trick

1670
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,799
as was done on those vervet monkeys

1671
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,839
researcher putting inside the bush there

1672
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,479
a speaker and playing the sound of like

1673
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:39,000
400 menacing Lions all at once and you

1674
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,040
know what you're supposed to do is freak

1675
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,040
out at that point and all of you need to

1676
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,839
very carefully approach and see what's

1677
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:47,359
going on in that bush so what would

1678
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,960
happen in a reciprocal system and

1679
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,198
everybody do this does this or if one

1680
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:54,279
time one of them cheats on you you push

1681
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:55,760
that one forward the next time time or

1682
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,280
some such thing that's what you would

1683
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,719
expect but what he would begin to notice

1684
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:02,040
is in a bunch of these groups there'd be

1685
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,120
one scaredy cat lion one who habitually

1686
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,679
stayed behind the others and who wasn't

1687
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:11,199
punished for it so this produced this

1688
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,080
first puzzle that oh sometimes animals

1689
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,280
aren't optimizing tit fortat sometimes

1690
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,320
animals haven't read Robert axelrod's

1691
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,199
Landmark 1972 paper that sort of thing

1692
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,840
and what you suddenly have is the real

1693
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,199
world what could be possible

1694
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:29,120
explanations one thing being maybe

1695
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,000
they're not really paying attention

1696
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,960
maybe they're not quite that smart wait

1697
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,640
bacteria are doing versions of tit

1698
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,320
fortat what else could be going on oh

1699
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,239
Lions interact in other Realms maybe

1700
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:43,640
this individual is doing very reciprocal

1701
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,880
stuff forgiving overly altruistic stuff

1702
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,520
in some other realm of behavior maybe

1703
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,480
this lion is eats less of the meat and

1704
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,360
backs off earlier or something like that

1705
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,560
maybe there's another game going on

1706
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,120
simultaneously and this introducing the

1707
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,000
real world in which it is not just two

1708
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,080
individuals sitting there playing

1709
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,400
prisoners dilemma and optimizing you

1710
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,080
suddenly begin to get real world

1711
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,280
complexities coming in there and by the

1712
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,360
time we get to the lectures way down the

1713
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,960
line on aggression and cooperation what

1714
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,080
you will see is things get really

1715
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,120
complicated when you have individuals

1716
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,760
playing games simultaneously the rules

1717
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,280
that you apply to Oney logically begin

1718
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,800
to dribble into the other one all sorts

1719
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,040
of things like that it will get very

1720
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,640
complicated so first hint there that in

1721
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,600
fact everything doesn't work perfectly

1722
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,480
along those lines here's another version

1723
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,760
here's one of the truly weird species

1724
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,040
out there something called the naked

1725
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,719
mole rat if you ever have nothing to do

1726
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,280
and you've got Google image up there go

1727
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,159
like spend the evening looking up

1728
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:53,480
closeup pictures of naked mole rats

1729
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,760
these are like the weirdest things out

1730
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,920
there they are the closest things among

1731
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,760
the mammals to social insects in terms

1732
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,960
of how their colonies work they're

1733
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,920
totally bizarre all of that but they

1734
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,639
live in these big Cooperative colonies

1735
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:09,719
that are predominantly underground in

1736
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:11,480
Africa and they were discovered I think

1737
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,199
only in the 1970s or so and for a while

1738
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,520
when zoologists got together if you were

1739
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,760
a naked mole rat person you were just

1740
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,639
the coolest around and everybody else

1741
01:12:20,639 --> 01:12:22,480
would feel intimidated cuz you were

1742
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,679
working on the best species out there

1743
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:26,560
and you would see these big Cooperative

1744
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,080
colonies soon shown to not necessarily

1745
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,639
be of relatives and reciprocity all

1746
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:34,360
those sorts of rules but people soon

1747
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,159
began to recognize there would be one or

1748
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:39,520
two animals in each colony that weren't

1749
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,080
doing any work work digging out

1750
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,159
tunnels bookkeeping I don't know what

1751
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:47,440
naked mole rats do in terms of work but

1752
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,000
there would be a few individuals who

1753
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,840
would just be sitting around and there

1754
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,320
was these big old naked mole rats they

1755
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,239
were much bigger than the other ones and

1756
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:57,560
were scarfing up food left and right

1757
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,760
there goes Robert Axel rod down the

1758
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,639
drain there goes all that optimization

1759
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:03,400
because no one would be punishing these

1760
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,520
guys what's the deal and it took enough

1761
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,600
watching these animals long enough to

1762
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,800
see this notion of oh there's another

1763
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,239
game going on in which they play a more

1764
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,840
important role and it is sort of

1765
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,679
dribbling across when the rainy season

1766
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,880
comes these big naked mole rats go up

1767
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,360
and turn around and they plug the entry

1768
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,080
to the tunnels there that's what they do

1769
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,679
and suddenly these guys who have been

1770
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:32,600
sitting around doing no work whatsoever

1771
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,239
all year and eating tons of stuff they

1772
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:36,960
suddenly have to now stick their rear

1773
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,199
ends out for the coyotes to be around or

1774
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,120
whatever it is that predates them what

1775
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,760
we have is role diversification real

1776
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,159
animals real organisms are not just

1777
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:49,960
playing one formal prisoners dilemma

1778
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,880
game against each other at the same time

1779
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,679
and by the time we again get to the

1780
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:56,639
later lectures on aggression cooperation

1781
01:13:56,639 --> 01:13:58,600
all of that we will not only see the

1782
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,719
things get much more complicated when

1783
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,920
you're playing simultaneous games when

1784
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,320
you're playing a game against one

1785
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,040
individual while you're playing against

1786
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,280
another one and them against triangular

1787
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,360
circumstances how play differs if you

1788
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,280
know how many rounds you were playing

1789
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,120
against the individual versus if you

1790
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,239
have no idea how play differs if when

1791
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,320
you were about to play against someone

1792
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,600
you get to find out what their behavior

1793
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,280
has been in the previous trials with

1794
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,280
other individuals in other words if

1795
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,080
somebody shows up with a reputation

1796
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,920
we'll see this is a much more

1797
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,719
complicated world of playing out these

1798
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,800
games a much more realistic one so we

1799
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,800
begin to see a first pass at all this

1800
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,040
optimization stuff and how great that

1801
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:43,400
all is one final interesting addition to

1802
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,560
this game theory world of thinking about

1803
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,719
Behavior like that which came from a guy

1804
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:49,800
named James Holland who

1805
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,800
apparently might have a different first

1806
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,320
name but Holland apparently is an

1807
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,800
interesting piece recent history he's

1808
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,320
the P first person to ever get a PhD in

1809
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,400
Computer Sciences which I think was in

1810
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,560
the late 50s University of Michigan

1811
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,800
apparently there are Realms of of

1812
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,880
computer programmers who worship this

1813
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,360
guy and he like a lot of other folks in

1814
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,000
that business got interested in this

1815
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,560
game theory evolution of optimal

1816
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,920
strategies and he designed ways of

1817
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,760
running all of this and he introduced a

1818
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,760
new Ripple which is the possibility of a

1819
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,199
strategy suddenly changing the

1820
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,880
possibility of a mutation

1821
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,840
and what he could then study was

1822
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,480
mutations how often they were adaptive

1823
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,239
how often they spread throughout the

1824
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:35,400
strategy there of individuals playing

1825
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,199
how often they drove the other

1826
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,159
strategies into Extinction versus ones

1827
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,239
that were quickly driven to Extinction

1828
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,320
themselves more cases where we are

1829
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,120
getting these systems where maybe

1830
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,960
they're not just metaphorically using

1831
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,719
terms from biology maybe they are

1832
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,920
exactly modeling the same thing and we

1833
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,880
will see more and more evidence for that

1834
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,639
okay so reciprocal altruism how would

1835
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:00,760
that play out in the world of natural

1836
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,679
selection natural selection Cooperative

1837
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,880
hunting and there's lots of species that

1838
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,320
have Cooperative hunting wild dogs

1839
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,000
Jackal some other species as well that's

1840
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,880
clearly that's like the definition of

1841
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,920
Cooperative hunting of Cooperative

1842
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,480
reciprocal altruism if they're not

1843
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,120
relatives how would sexual selection

1844
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,719
play out in the realm of reciprocal

1845
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,320
altruism a little bit less obvious there

1846
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,960
that would be if you and some

1847
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,159
non-relative spend an insane amount of

1848
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:29,520
energy and time making sure you both

1849
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,000
look really good before going to the

1850
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,159
prom that would be sexual selection

1851
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,639
working on reciprocal altruistic system

1852
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:38,800
so what we have now are our three

1853
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,040
building blocks this whole trashing of

1854
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,280
it's not survival of the fittest it's

1855
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,679
not behaving for the good of the species

1856
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:48,040
it's not behaving for the good of the

1857
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,920
group but instead these three building

1858
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,760
blocks the ways to optimize as many

1859
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,920
copies of your genes in the next

1860
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,800
generation is possible way number one

1861
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,120
individual selection a version of

1862
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,639
selfish jeans sometimes a chicken is an

1863
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:05,080
egg way of making another egg behavior

1864
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,840
is just the way of getting copies of

1865
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,520
genes into the Next Generation piece

1866
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,960
number two Inclusive fitness kin

1867
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,800
selection that whole business that's

1868
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,000
Sometimes the best way of passing on

1869
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,520
copies is to help relatives do it and

1870
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,280
it's as a function of how related there

1871
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,040
the whole world of cooperation more

1872
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,560
among related organisms than unrelated

1873
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,320
ones and as we will see way down the

1874
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,560
line what is very challenging in

1875
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,480
different species is how do you figure

1876
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,280
out who you're related to and humans do

1877
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,800
it in a very unique way that sets them

1878
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,360
up for being exploited in all sorts of

1879
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,320
circumstances that begin to explain why

1880
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,320
culture after culture people are really

1881
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,360
not nice to thems and it flows along

1882
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,840
those lines this is something we will

1883
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,199
get to in a lot of detail so degree of

1884
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:54,440
relatedness a lecture coming how do you

1885
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,560
tell who who you're related to but that

1886
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,400
second piece kin selection third piece

1887
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,840
reciprocal altruism you scratch my back

1888
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,360
and I'll scratch your back and whenever

1889
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,480
possible you want to instead scratch

1890
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,920
your back and they want to make sure

1891
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,679
you're not scratching your back or

1892
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,719
whatever cheating counts as but trying

1893
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:13,800
to cheat being vigilant against it

1894
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,400
formal games where you can optimize it

1895
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,880
very complicated and can you believe it

1896
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,600
you go out into the real world and you

1897
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,199
find examples of precisely that

1898
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,159
optimization with Tit for Tat is nature

1899
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,400
wonderful it's got to work that way and

1900
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,239
then you begin to see how the real world

1901
01:18:29,239 --> 01:18:32,760
is more complicated multiple roles naked

1902
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,719
mole rats stuck in plumbing things of

1903
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,560
that sort okay so these are the

1904
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,760
principles and what people of the school

1905
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,320
of evolutionary thought would say armed

1906
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,400
with these sorts of principles you could

1907
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,600
now look at all sorts of interesting

1908
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,639
domains of animal behavior and

1909
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:51,159
understand what the behavior is going to

1910
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,920
be like by using these okay we start

1911
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,440
with the first example

1912
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,639
here we return to these guys and we have

1913
01:18:58,639 --> 01:19:01,679
one species here and knowing this guy

1914
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,800
had a penis and this one nursed we've

1915
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,040
got an adult male an adult female what

1916
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,120
is it that you can conclude in this

1917
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,520
species males are a lot bigger than

1918
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,040
females so let's state it here as

1919
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,760
there's a big ratio of males to females

1920
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,639
meanwhile in the next County you've

1921
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:20,040
discovered another species where

1922
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,600
somebody's got a penis and somebody else

1923
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,440
is nursing and their skulls are the

1924
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,840
exact same size oh here's a species

1925
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,440
where there's no difference in body size

1926
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,480
between males and females okay so let's

1927
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,480
begin to see just using the principles

1928
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,880
we've got in hand already what sort of

1929
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,320
stuff we can

1930
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,480
predict starting okay which of those

1931
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,960
species in one case you have males being

1932
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,159
a lot bigger than females in one case

1933
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,000
you've got males being the same size as

1934
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,600
females and which of those species the

1935
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,760
first one like this or the same siiz

1936
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,320
ones and which ones would you expect to

1937
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,320
see more male

1938
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:01,239
aggression first one okay how

1939
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:04,000
come their bodies are built for it which

1940
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,639
begins to tell you something their

1941
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:07,480
bodies are built for it maybe because

1942
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,400
females have been selecting for that you

1943
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,560
will see higher levels of aggression in

1944
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,440
species like this where there's a big

1945
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,520
body size difference and much less of it

1946
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,400
in these guys next you now ask how much

1947
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,320
variability is there in male productive

1948
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,679
success in one of these species all the

1949
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:31,480
males have one or two kids over their

1950
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:35,000
lifetime in another species 95% of the

1951
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,719
reproducing is carried out by 5% of the

1952
01:20:37,719 --> 01:20:41,239
males a huge variability skew in male

1953
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:43,800
reproductive success which species do

1954
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,480
you get the every male has a couple of

1955
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,440
kids and that's about it and all equally

1956
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,960
so which

1957
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:54,800
one second one how come

1958
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,400
because these guys are being selected

1959
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,800
for aggression if they're fighting there

1960
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,159
is going to have to be something they're

1961
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:05,719
fighting for differential reproductive

1962
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:09,920
access okay so you see more

1963
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,719
variability in species that look like

1964
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,280
this next females come into the equation

1965
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,760
what do females want what do females

1966
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,760
want in the species on the left versus

1967
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,560
the one on the right the one on the

1968
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,400
right you know again skull the same size

1969
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,760
same body size on the left what does the

1970
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,239
female

1971
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:34,159
want what sort of male is the female

1972
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:38,280
interested in big exactly that's exactly

1973
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,520
the driving force on this how come

1974
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,400
because she's not going to get anything

1975
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,520
else out of this guy this guy is just

1976
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,880
going to like the Pres is going to be

1977
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,000
some sperm it might as well be some good

1978
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
sperm some genetically well-endowed

1979
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,040
sperm that makes for a big healthy

1980
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,719
Offspring increasing the odds of her

1981
01:21:55,719 --> 01:21:57,159
passing on copies of her genes in the

1982
01:21:57,159 --> 01:22:00,320
Next Generation what about in this

1983
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,360
species what's females looking

1984
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:09,880
for okay good hold on to that for a

1985
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:13,440
second and let's Jump Ahead a few lines

1986
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,920
one of the species males have never been

1987
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,960
known to do the slightest affiliative

1988
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,800
thing with infants they just get

1989
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,560
irritated and harass them and all of

1990
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,840
that and the other you have soccer dads

1991
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,679
who are doing as much raising of the

1992
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:31,080
kids as the females are in which species

1993
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,199
do you get lots of male parental

1994
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,080
Behavior the one on the right okay so

1995
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,880
lots of male parental Behavior

1996
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,480
here so somebody just gave the answer

1997
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,679
here female Choice what would you see in

1998
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:49,639
this species you want big muscular guys

1999
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:52,040
you want whatever is selling that season

2000
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,600
for what counts as a hot male because

2001
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,480
you want your Offspring to have those

2002
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,120
traits and somebody else called out here

2003
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,719
what do females want in this category

2004
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:04,080
and what was it you said good

2005
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:08,639
personality good personality yes able to

2006
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,400
express

2007
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,120
emotions that

2008
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,320
too okay somebody else shouted out

2009
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,480
something that gets at the broader more

2010
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,360
globally Oprah version okay somebody

2011
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:24,239
shouted out P parental Behavior you want

2012
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,360
a male who is going to be competent at

2013
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,679
raising your children what is it that

2014
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:31,520
you want really most deeply you want to

2015
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,719
get the male who is the most like a

2016
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:36,040
female you can get a hold of you don't

2017
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,400
want some big old stupid guy with a lot

2018
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,480
of muscle and canines who's wasting

2019
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,480
energy on stuff like that that he could

2020
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,800
be using instead on you know reading

2021
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,239
good night moon or some such thing what

2022
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:50,760
you want instead is somebody who's as

2023
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,560
close to a female as you can get to

2024
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,639
without getting this lactation stuff

2025
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,120
males are chosen who are the same size

2026
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:02,719
as females so the term given here is you

2027
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,679
know choosing for paternal Behavior

2028
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:06,840
parental Behavior parental let's just

2029
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,120
put that in there and that begins to

2030
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,360
explain the Top Line species in which

2031
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,440
there's a lot of sexual dimorphism

2032
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,719
morphism Shapes of Things sexual

2033
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,840
dimorphism big difference in body size

2034
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,360
as a function of gender and in these

2035
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,719
sorts of species where you get male Al

2036
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,840
Behavior not much variability male

2037
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,560
reproductive success low levels of

2038
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,239
aggression and what females want is a

2039
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,199
competent male these are ones where you

2040
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:35,760
see low degrees of sexual dimorphism so

2041
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,600
how's a female going to figure out that

2042
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,040
this guy is going to be a competent

2043
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,920
parent you know once again we just

2044
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,280
figured out if he looks kind of like you

2045
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,040
because that suggests he hasn't wasted

2046
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,040
health and Metabolism on stupid

2047
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,639
pointless muscles when there's more

2048
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,320
important things in life for making sure

2049
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,400
your kids have good values what else

2050
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,800
would the female want to know when she's

2051
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,480
first considering mating with the

2052
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,119
male is he a nice guy is he sensitive

2053
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:02,040
does he Express his feelings is he

2054
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,960
competent at being a parent what do you

2055
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,920
want the individual to do prove to you

2056
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,840
that he can provide for the kids and

2057
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,719
suddenly you have a world of bird male

2058
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:16,040
birds courting the females by bringing

2059
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,800
them worms bringing them evidence that

2060
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,960
they are able to successfully forage

2061
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,679
they are able to get food female choices

2062
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:24,840
built around

2063
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,719
appearance and behavioral competence at

2064
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,840
being able to be a successful parent in

2065
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,560
order to pass on as many copies of genes

2066
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,600
the Next Generation as possible okay how

2067
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,520
about

2068
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,440
lifespan in which species is there a big

2069
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,360
difference and life expectancy is a

2070
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,600
function of

2071
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,239
gender first one here are you choosing

2072
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,280
for males to be as close to females as

2073
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,760
possible andless the physiology here you

2074
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,320
got these guys who are like using huge

2075
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,320
amounts of energy to build up all this

2076
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,639
muscle which takes a lot more work to

2077
01:25:55,639 --> 01:25:58,000
keep in calories and you're more

2078
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,040
vulnerable in famines you've got these

2079
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,440
males with high testosterone which does

2080
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,080
bad stuff to your circulatory system

2081
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,040
you've got males who thanks to all this

2082
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,199
aggression are getting more injuries

2083
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,840
more likely in species in which you have

2084
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,880
a lot of sexual dimorphism in body size

2085
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,880
you get a lot of sexual dimorphism in

2086
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,600
lifespan and then you look at these guys

2087
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,639
and it's basically no difference by

2088
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:26,280
gender moving on considering primates

2089
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,480
that are of one of these two patterns in

2090
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,719
which one do you always want to give

2091
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,880
birth to twins in which one do you never

2092
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,600
want to give birth to twins who gives

2093
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,600
birth to

2094
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,440
twins the one on the right of course how

2095
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,639
come because you got two parents on the

2096
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,719
scene you are not a single mother and

2097
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,960
you are a single mother rees's monkey or

2098
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,840
something and you give birth to twins

2099
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,159
and you do not have the remotest chance

2100
01:26:49,159 --> 01:26:51,239
of enough energy enough calories on

2101
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:54,239
board to get both of them to survive a

2102
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:57,760
twin that is born in a species like this

2103
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,280
has the same rate that it occurs in

2104
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,760
humans about a 1% rate and it is almost

2105
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,520
inevitable that one of them does not

2106
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,159
survive meanwhile there's a whole world

2107
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,560
of primate species with this profile

2108
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,159
where the females always

2109
01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:16,119
twin finally you are the female and you

2110
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:18,679
are con contemplating bailing out on

2111
01:27:18,679 --> 01:27:20,760
your kids and disappearing because

2112
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,960
there's some really hot guy over there

2113
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,800
who you want to mate with

2114
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,600
and you are trying to figure out this

2115
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,159
strategy so you are going to leave and

2116
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:31,800
abandon your kids in which species do

2117
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,040
you see that

2118
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,320
behavior the one on the right the one on

2119
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,600
the right because you bail out and the

2120
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,239
male is there taking care of them you

2121
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:41,440
bail out in here and you've lost your

2122
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,159
investment and copies of your genes for

2123
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:45,400
the Next Generation you see female

2124
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,159
cuckoldry this great Victorian term you

2125
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,760
see females cheating on the fathers in

2126
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,400
this species but not in species like

2127
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,119
this because the father is long gone in

2128
01:27:56,119 --> 01:27:58,000
you know three other counties there

2129
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,360
according somebody else and doesn't

2130
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,600
matter you're not going to get any help

2131
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,080
from him in primate species of this

2132
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,360
profile you always see twinning and they

2133
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,760
both survive and what Studies have shown

2134
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,320
in these species and we'll get to them

2135
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,480
shortly is after birth in fact the males

2136
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,000
are expending more calories taking care

2137
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,440
of The Offspring than the females go

2138
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,800
bail out on him and go find some other

2139
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,840
hot guy which in your species counts as

2140
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,639
some guy who looks even more like you

2141
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:27,840
than he does in terms of what you want

2142
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,280
out of the individual so that so what

2143
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,639
have we done here we've just gone

2144
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:33,760
through applying these principles in

2145
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,920
this logical way and everybody from the

2146
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,760
very first step was getting the right

2147
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,119
outcome and go and these are exactly the

2148
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:43,600
profiles you find in certain species

2149
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,760
among social mammals these would be

2150
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,800
referred to as a tornament species a

2151
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,960
tornament species whereas the one on the

2152
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,320
right is referred to as a pair bonding a

2153
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,360
monogamous species because in this one

2154
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,400
males and females stay together because

2155
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,920
they both have equivalent investment in

2156
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,239
taking care of the kids all of that what

2157
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,119
you have here is this contrast between

2158
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:09,080
tornament species and pair bonding

2159
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,280
species tornament species these are all

2160
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,360
the species where you get males with big

2161
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,560
bright plumage these are peacocks these

2162
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,639
are all those bird and fish species

2163
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:22,760
where the males are all brightly colored

2164
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,080
what are the females choosing for

2165
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,080
peacock feathers does not make for a

2166
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:30,040
good peacock mother peacock feathers are

2167
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,159
signs of being healthy enough that you

2168
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,159
can waste lots of energy on these big

2169
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,560
stupid pointless feathers that's a sign

2170
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,920
of Health that's a sign of all I'm

2171
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,159
getting from this peacock as jeans I

2172
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:43,040
might as well go for good ones that's

2173
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,560
the world of peacocks that's the world

2174
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,920
of chickens with pecking orders

2175
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,320
dominating like that lots of aggression

2176
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,080
that's the world of primates where as in

2177
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,400
Savannah baboons the male is twice as

2178
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,320
big as the female tornament species

2179
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,320
where a lot of passing on of genes is

2180
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,080
decided by male male aggression in the

2181
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,800
context of tournaments producing massive

2182
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,840
amounts of

2183
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,400
variability in reproductive success

2184
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,360
where males are being selected for being

2185
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,119
good like this so they sure being

2186
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:15,239
selected for having big bodies which

2187
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:17,080
winds up meaning a shortened lifespan

2188
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,520
for a bunch of reasons females are

2189
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,560
choosing for that these are guys who are

2190
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,159
not using their energy on Parental

2191
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:24,159
Behavior thus you do not want to have

2192
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,280
twins if you were a female baboon and

2193
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,000
you do not want to bail out on the kids

2194
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,239
because nobody else is going to take

2195
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:31,639
care of them go and look at a new

2196
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:34,320
primate species and see this much of a

2197
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,719
difference in skull size and you've just

2198
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,679
be able to derive everything else about

2199
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:41,800
its social behavior meanwhile these guys

2200
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,119
on the right peir bonding species these

2201
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:46,400
are found among South American monkeys

2202
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,840
Mar missets tamarinds you put up a

2203
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,600
picture of them which I will do if I

2204
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,239
ever Master PowerPoint in some

2205
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,159
subsequent lecture you put up a picture

2206
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,719
of a maret pair and you can't tell who's

2207
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:58,880
the male and the female this is not the

2208
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,560
world of mandrel baboons with males with

2209
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,920
big bright bizarre coloration on the

2210
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,280
face and with antlers when the females

2211
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,719
don't and that whole world of sexual

2212
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,760
dimorphism you can't tell which one is

2213
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,080
the male and which one is the female

2214
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,520
maret by looking at them you can't tell

2215
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,560
by seeing how long they live you can't

2216
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,360
tell by how much they're taking care of

2217
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,280
the kids you can't tell in terms of

2218
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,639
their reproductive variability that's a

2219
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:25,119
whole different world of selection all

2220
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:26,960
of the South American Tamarind and

2221
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,119
marmosets the females always twin they

2222
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:32,000
have a higher rate of aldry of

2223
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,400
abandoning the kids the males take as

2224
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,040
much care if not more of the kids than

2225
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,000
the female does very low levels of

2226
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,520
aggression same body size same lifespan

2227
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,159
all the males have low degree of

2228
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,440
variability how come because if you're

2229
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:47,320
some maret male you don't want to get 47

2230
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,000
maret females pregnant because you are

2231
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,440
going to have to take care of all the

2232
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:54,000
kids because as we will see way down on

2233
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,600
the line in lectures on Parental

2234
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,400
Behavior the wiring there as such as

2235
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,480
bonding with The Offspring and taking

2236
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,080
care of them no wonder among species

2237
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,800
like these you have very low variability

2238
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,199
all the males reproduce once or twice

2239
01:32:08,199 --> 01:32:10,360
this is the world of 5% of the guys

2240
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:13,080
accounting for 95% of the matings this

2241
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:16,360
is totally remarkable because again that

2242
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,600
starting point you start off here and

2243
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,159
you look at these and oh you can tell if

2244
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,000
they were bipedal and or they diseased

2245
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,639
and Mal nourish simply by a applying

2246
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:27,320
these principles of individual selection

2247
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,360
reciprocity all of that one factoid you

2248
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,880
see a new primate species and you see

2249
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,080
one nursing and one with a penis and

2250
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,840
they're the same size or there is

2251
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,440
different to the size and you already

2252
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:41,440
know all about their social system very

2253
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,840
consistent across Birds

2254
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,440
across fish across primates of all of

2255
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,719
those this dichotomy between tornament

2256
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:52,600
species and parab bonding species as we

2257
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,239
will see way down the line among some

2258
01:32:55,239 --> 01:32:58,280
species types of vs rodents that are

2259
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,600
famous in Hallmark cards for their pair

2260
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,000
bonding for their monogamy so we'll see

2261
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,760
they're not quite as monogamous as you

2262
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,040
would think but nonetheless a general

2263
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,440
structure like

2264
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:12,560
this so one asks expectedly where do

2265
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,400
humans fit in on this one where do

2266
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:18,280
humans fit and the answer is

2267
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:20,800
complicatedly are we a tornament species

2268
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,360
are we a parab bonding species what's up

2269
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,280
with that

2270
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:27,480
what we will see is we're kind of in

2271
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,800
between when you look at the degree of

2272
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,119
sexual dimorphism we are not like

2273
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:33,639
baboons but we're sure not like

2274
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:36,159
marmosets we're somewhere in the middle

2275
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,440
variability is somewhere in the middle

2276
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,639
there I'm not going near that one

2277
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:44,119
lifespan the dimorphism and lifespan

2278
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:47,360
tends to be in between and parental

2279
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,360
behavior and likelihood all of those you

2280
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,880
look at a number of measures and by next

2281
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,800
lecture we will be looking at some

2282
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,600
genetics of what monogamous species and

2283
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,119
tornament species look like and we're

2284
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:02,360
right in the middle in other words that

2285
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,600
explains like 90% of literature because

2286
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,679
we're not a classic tornament species

2287
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,360
and we're not a classic parab bonding

2288
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,679
one we are terribly confused in the

2289
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,840
middle there and everything about

2290
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:18,280
anthropology supports that most people

2291
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:21,719
on the planet right now are in a form of

2292
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:24,280
monogamous relationships in a culture

2293
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,960
that allows that demands

2294
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,280
monogamy an awful lot of people who are

2295
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,000
in monogamous relationships in such

2296
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
cultures aren't really monogamous

2297
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,400
relationships traditionally most

2298
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,880
cultures on this planet allowed polygamy

2299
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,199
nonetheless in most of those polygamous

2300
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,639
cultures the majority of individuals

2301
01:34:43,639 --> 01:34:46,080
were parab bonded and monogamous you get

2302
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,800
two different versions of polygamy in

2303
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,040
different social systems of humans one

2304
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,119
is economic polygamy which is your

2305
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:55,119
basically sitting around and the

2306
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:57,920
wealthiest guy in the village is the one

2307
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,600
who can have the largest number of wives

2308
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,320
an enormous skew and reproductive

2309
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,960
success that's driven by economics the

2310
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,440
other type is demographic you have a

2311
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,679
culture where for example you have a

2312
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,440
warrior class guys spent 10 years as

2313
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,280
Warriors Warriors Warriors New York City

2314
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,800
accent as Warriors they don't worry

2315
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,280
there's no anxiety but they eventually

2316
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,719
worry about getting a wife because by

2317
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:22,440
the time they're done being a warrior

2318
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,159
they're like 25

2319
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:26,400
and they marry someone who's 13 which is

2320
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,840
what you see in a lot of traditional

2321
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,920
cultures that follow that pattern and at

2322
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,040
that point you got a problem which is an

2323
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,199
awful lot of those guys have been killed

2324
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,719
over the course of 10 years of being

2325
01:35:37,719 --> 01:35:39,719
involved in high levels of aggression

2326
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:41,679
and 10 more years of life expectancy to

2327
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,679
catch up with you there's a shortage of

2328
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,560
males so you see polygamy there driven

2329
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,480
by demographics and you see polygamy

2330
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,520
driven by economics and other types of

2331
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,920
society so most cultures on the this

2332
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,440
planet allow traditionally before the

2333
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,520
missionaries got them most cultures on

2334
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,239
this planet allow polygamy nonetheless

2335
01:36:01,239 --> 01:36:03,719
within most polygamous cultures the

2336
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:06,600
majority of people are not polygamous we

2337
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,600
have one really confused screwed up

2338
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,320
Species here because we are halfway in

2339
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,400
between in all sorts of these measures

2340
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,840
okay so what do we have next which we

2341
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,880
will pick up on on Friday what we've

2342
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,800
just started with here is the first case

2343
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,280
of using all these principles individual

2344
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,760
selection kin selection reciprocal

2345
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,119
altruism to understand all sorts of

2346
01:36:28,119 --> 01:36:30,560
aspects of behavior we will then move on

2347
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,040
to seeing how they explain other aspects

2348
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,679
of animal behavior some ones which if

2349
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:37,400
you are behaving for the good of the

2350
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,239
species circa 1960 there's no

2351
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,400
explanation at all because you're doing

2352
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,520
things like killing other members of

2353
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,960
your species and then finally we will

2354
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,440
see how this applies to humans and some

2355
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,840
