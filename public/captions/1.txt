This is BIO 150, isn’t it? Okay, just wanted to make sure.

Okay, so we start off with a scenario. 40 year-old guy — quiet, suburban life. Married 15 years, two kids, three and a half dogs, everything’s standard, everything’s going wonderfully. And one day out of nowhere, he punches somebody in the face at work. Totally bizarre, out of character. The guy is standing there by the water cooler and makes some comment on some baseball team, takes exception to it, punches him in the face. Utterly strange. Things are quiet.

Three months later, his wife of 15 years happy marriage discovers he’s having an affair with a 16-year-old checkout kid down at the Safeway. Really weird.

Then three months after that, he absconds with all the money at work, embezzles it, disappears, and is never seen again.

Three possibilities. First one, this guy is a truly deep creep. Second, he is having the most immature midlife crisis you could ever imagine. Third possibility, he has a mutation in one gene in his head.

And what we will be seeing is this is exactly the profile that you get in a certain neurological disease where it’s one gene that’s out of whack. First demonstration of that.
